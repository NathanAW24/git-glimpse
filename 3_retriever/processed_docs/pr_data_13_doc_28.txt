## Walkthrough
The update to the `modal.ts` component involves a modification to the `full` style definition by adding `min-h-[100dvh]`. This change ensures that modals with a `size="full"` attribute correctly display as fullscreen, enhancing their responsiveness and usability, particularly with the `scrollBehavior="inside"` property.

## Changes

| File Path | Change Summary |
|-----------|----------------|
| `packages/core/theme/src/components/modal.ts` | Added `min-h-[100dvh]` to `full` style definition |

## Assessment against linked issues

| Objective | Addressed | Explanation |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| Ensure modals with `size="full"` remain fullscreen when `scrollBehavior="inside"` is used (#2681) | ‚úÖ |  |
| Ensure correct display in various browsers and operating systems as reported in issue (#2681) | ‚ùì | Specific browser and OS testing should be verified manually or through automated tests, not clear from the code change alone. |

## Possibly related PRs
- **#3495**: This PR addresses CSS styling in the modal component, specifically modifying height properties, which is directly related to the changes made in the main PR regarding modal height adjustments.
- **#3691**: This PR focuses on modal positioning adjustments when the keyboard appears, which involves dynamic height management similar to the changes in the main PR that set a minimum height for modals.

.changeset/nervous-mirrors-rule.md: ## AI-generated summary of changes

This update introduces a patch to the `@nextui-org/theme` package, specifically addressing the minimum height setting for elements designated with a size of `full`. The change establishes that the minimum height should be set to `100dvh` (100% of the dynamic viewport height) when the size is specified as `full`. This adjustment enhances the responsiveness and usability of components that utilize this theme, ensuring they occupy the full height of the viewport dynamically, which is particularly beneficial for mobile and varying screen sizes. The implementation of this logic is crucial for maintaining a consistent user experience across different devices.



## Alterations to the declarations of exported or public entities

- Added: Patch to `@nextui-org/theme` to set min-height to `100dvh` for size `full` in `.changeset/nervous-mirrors-rule.md`

## PR Summary

The pull request titled "fix(modal): set the min-height of base height to 100dvh where size equals 'full'" was created by user HydenLiu and is identified as PR number 2684. This PR addresses an issue related to the modal component in the NextUI library. Specifically, it sets the minimum height of the modal to 100dvh (100% of the viewport height) when the modal size is specified as "full." This change aims to ensure that the modal behaves correctly in fullscreen mode.

The PR closes issue #2681, which reported a bug where the modal did not maintain fullscreen status when the `scrollBehavior` was set to "inside." The author has indicated that this change does not introduce any breaking changes for existing users of NextUI.

## Objectives from Linked Issues

The linked issue #2681 describes a bug in the NextUI modal component where the modal does not function correctly when both `size="full"` and `scrollBehavior="inside"` are used. The user reported that the modal fails to remain fullscreen under these conditions, which is contrary to the expected behavior. 

The issue was demonstrated with a code example, highlighting that when the modal is opened with the specified props, it does not occupy the full screen as intended. The user provided a link to a CodeSandbox example to illustrate the problem and included a screenshot showing the modal's incorrect display. The expected behavior is for the modal to maintain its fullscreen status regardless of the scroll behavior setting. The issue was reported on the NextUI version 2.2.10 and was observed on a Windows operating system using the Chrome browser.

### Chat

There are 3 ways to chat with [CodeRabbit](https://coderabbit.ai):

- Review comments: Directly reply to a review comment made by CodeRabbit. Example:
	- `I pushed a fix in commit <commit_id>.`
	- `Generate unit testing code for this file.`
	- `Open a follow-up GitHub issue for this discussion.`
- Files and specific lines of code (under the "Files changed" tab): Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new review comment at the desired location with your query. Examples:
	- `@coderabbitai generate unit testing code for this file.`
	-	`@coderabbitai modularize this function.`
- PR comments: Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new PR comment to ask questions about the PR branch. For the best results, please provide a very specific query, as very limited context is provided in this mode. Examples:
	- `@coderabbitai generate interesting stats about this repository and render them as a table.`
	- `@coderabbitai show all the console.log statements in this repository.`
	- `@coderabbitai read src/utils.ts and generate unit testing code.`
	- `@coderabbitai read the files in the src/scheduler package and generate a class diagram using mermaid and a README in the markdown format.`
	- `@coderabbitai help me debug CodeRabbit configuration file.`

Note: Be mindful of the bot's finite context window. It's strongly recommended to break down tasks such as reading entire modules into smaller chunks. For a focused discussion, use review comments to chat about specific files and their changes, instead of using the PR comments.

- `@coderabbitai pause` to pause the reviews on a PR.
- `@coderabbitai resume` to resume the paused reviews.
- `@coderabbitai review` to trigger an incremental review. This is useful when automatic reviews are disabled for the repository.
- `@coderabbitai full review` to do a full review from scratch and review all the files again.
- `@coderabbitai summary` to regenerate the summary of the PR.
- `@coderabbitai resolve` resolve all the CodeRabbit review comments.
