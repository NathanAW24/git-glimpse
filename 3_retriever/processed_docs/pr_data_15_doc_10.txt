## Walkthrough

The modification in the project addresses the need for Right-to-Left (RTL) support by updating the styling of components. Specifically, it involves adding a `rtl:space-x-reverse` class to the `<div>` elements in the `divider.stories.tsx` file. This change ensures that elements within the divider component correctly align and display in RTL languages, enhancing usability and accessibility for a broader audience.

### PR Objectives

The primary objective of this pull request (PR #2484) is to address and resolve a specific issue identified in the project's Storybook concerning the lack of support for Right-to-Left (RTL) directionality, particularly affecting the divider component. This issue was detailed in a linked GitHub issue (#2483), which highlighted the problem of elements displaying incorrectly when the document direction is set to RTL, as is common in languages like Arabic. The problem was evidenced by misalignment and display issues, negatively impacting usability for users requiring RTL support.

The PR aims to introduce necessary changes to ensure that the divider component within Storybook properly handles RTL directionality. This involves adjusting the component's alignment and functionality to accommodate RTL layouts, thereby ensuring that elements are displayed correctly from right to left. The proposed changes are focused on enhancing the user interface to fully support RTL direction, addressing the visual discrepancies previously identified. This includes modifying the styling class in the `divider.stories.tsx` file to include a new `rtl:space-x-reverse` class, which affects the layout of elements within the divider component, ensuring they align correctly in RTL mode.

By implementing these changes, the PR seeks to rectify the deficiency in RTL support within the repository, ensuring that the UI is accessible and functional for users who interact with the application in RTL languages. This enhancement is crucial for improving the overall user experience, making the application more inclusive and accommodating to a broader audience. The PR emphasizes the importance of small, focused changes to achieve a specific improvement, in this case, enhancing RTL support for a single component within the project's Storybook.

### AI-Generated Summary of Generated Summaries

The pull request introduces a targeted fix to the `divider.stories.tsx` file within the project's Storybook, specifically aimed at enhancing support for Right-to-Left (RTL) directionality for the divider component. This is achieved by adding a new styling class, `rtl:space-x-reverse`, to a `<div>` element within the component. This modification ensures that elements within the divider component are correctly aligned and displayed when the document direction is set to RTL, addressing the previously identified issue of misalignment and display problems in RTL languages like Arabic. The change is a direct response to the need for improved RTL support, as detailed in the linked GitHub issue (#2483), and represents a focused effort to enhance the user interface for RTL users without introducing breaking changes to the project.

### Chat

There are 3 ways to chat with CodeRabbit:

- Review comments: Directly reply to a review comment made by CodeRabbit. Example:
	- `I pushed a fix in commit <commit_id>.`
	- `Generate unit-tests for this file.`
	- `Open a follow-up GitHub issue for this discussion.`
- Files and specific lines of code (under the "Files changed" tab): Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new review comment at the desired location with your query. Examples:
	- `@coderabbitai generate unit tests for this file.`
	-	`@coderabbitai modularize this function.`
- PR comments: Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new PR comment to ask questions about the PR branch. For the best results, please provide a very specific query, as very limited context is provided in this mode. Examples:
	- `@coderabbitai generate interesting stats about this repository and render them as a table.`
	- `@coderabbitai show all the console.log statements in this repository.`
	- `@coderabbitai read src/utils.ts and generate unit tests.`
	- `@coderabbitai read the files in the src/scheduler package and generate a class diagram using mermaid and a README in the markdown format.`

Note: Be mindful of the bot's finite context window. It's strongly recommended to break down tasks such as reading entire modules into smaller chunks. For a focused discussion, use review comments to chat about specific files and their changes, instead of using the PR comments.
