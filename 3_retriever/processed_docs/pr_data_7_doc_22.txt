## Walkthrough

The recent changes introduced a patch to the `@nextui-org/theme` package, specifically addressing the `disableAnimation` property in the button component. This update ensures that the button does not rescale on press when `disableAnimation` is set to true, fixing the bug that required an additional class override to achieve the expected behavior.

## PR summary

**Title:** fix(button)/rescaling in disable animation  
**User:** abhinandan-verma  
**Number:** 3490  
**URL:** [https://github.com/nextui-org/nextui/pull/3490](https://github.com/nextui-org/nextui/pull/3490)  

**Description:**  
The pull request addresses an issue with the button component's `disableAnimation` prop. The current behavior causes the button to rescale on press, even when `disableAnimation` is set to true. The fix ensures that no rescaling occurs when `disableAnimation` is enabled. The change is not a breaking change.

## Objectives from linked issues

**Issue #3489:**  
The `disableAnimation` prop in the Button component of NextUI is not functioning as expected. Instead of disabling the rescaling animation on press, users need to add a `data-[pressed=true]:scale-100` class override to achieve the desired behavior. The issue was traced to a specific line in the button component's source code, which is applied even when `disableAnimation` is set. The expected behavior is that the button should not resize on press when `disableAnimation` is passed. The problem was identified in version `@nextui-org/button@2.0.31` and can be observed in the Storybook example.

### Chat

There are 3 ways to chat with [CodeRabbit](https://coderabbit.ai):

- Review comments: Directly reply to a review comment made by CodeRabbit. Example:
	- `I pushed a fix in commit <commit_id>.`
	- `Generate unit testing code for this file.`
	- `Open a follow-up GitHub issue for this discussion.`
- Files and specific lines of code (under the "Files changed" tab): Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new review comment at the desired location with your query. Examples:
	- `@coderabbitai generate unit testing code for this file.`
	-	`@coderabbitai modularize this function.`
- PR comments: Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new PR comment to ask questions about the PR branch. For the best results, please provide a very specific query, as very limited context is provided in this mode. Examples:
	- `@coderabbitai generate interesting stats about this repository and render them as a table.`
	- `@coderabbitai show all the console.log statements in this repository.`
	- `@coderabbitai read src/utils.ts and generate unit testing code.`
	- `@coderabbitai read the files in the src/scheduler package and generate a class diagram using mermaid and a README in the markdown format.`
	- `@coderabbitai help me debug CodeRabbit configuration file.`

Note: Be mindful of the bot's finite context window. It's strongly recommended to break down tasks such as reading entire modules into smaller chunks. For a focused discussion, use review comments to chat about specific files and their changes, instead of using the PR comments.

### CodeRabbit Commands (invoked as PR comments)

- `@coderabbitai pause` to pause the reviews on a PR.
- `@coderabbitai resume` to resume the paused reviews.
- `@coderabbitai review` to trigger an incremental review. This is useful when automatic reviews are disabled for the repository.
- `@coderabbitai full review` to do a full review from scratch and review all the files again.
- `@coderabbitai summary` to regenerate the summary of the PR.
- `@coderabbitai resolve` resolve all the CodeRabbit review comments.
- `@coderabbitai configuration` to show the current CodeRabbit configuration for the repository.
- `@coderabbitai help` to get help.


Additionally, you can add `@coderabbitai ignore` anywhere in the PR description to prevent this PR from being reviewed.

### CodeRabbit Configuration File (`.coderabbit.yaml`)

- You can programmatically configure CodeRabbit by adding a `.coderabbit.yaml` file to the root of your repository.
- Please see the [configuration documentation](https://docs.coderabbit.ai/guides/configure-coderabbit) for more information.
