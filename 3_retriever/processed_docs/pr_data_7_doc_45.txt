apps/docs/components/marketing/hero/floating-components.tsx: ## AI-generated summary of changes

The diff reflects several adjustments to the positioning of various components within the `FloatingComponents` React functional component. Specifically, the changes involve modifying the CSS classes that dictate the absolute positioning of elements, resulting in a shift in their vertical and horizontal placements. 

1. The `Input` component's position has been altered from `-top-[130px] -right-[120px]` to `-top-[60px] -right-[80px]`, moving it higher and closer to the right.
2. The `Card` component's position has been adjusted from `-top-[260px]` to `-top-[270px]`, indicating a slight downward shift.
3. The `UserTwitterCard` component's left position has been changed from `left-[80px]` to `left-[30px]`, moving it further left while maintaining its top position.
4. The positioning of another `Card` component has been modified from `right-[110px] -top-[60px]` to `right-[150px] -top-[50px]`, moving it further right and slightly higher.
5. Lastly, a `div` containing a `Pagination` component has seen its position change from `-top-[40px] -right-[230px]` to `-top-[120px] -right-[90px]`, moving it significantly higher and closer to the right.

These changes primarily affect the layout and visual arrangement of the components without altering their underlying functionality.

<summary>Tips</summary>

### Chat

There are 3 ways to chat with [CodeRabbit](https://coderabbit.ai):

- Review comments: Directly reply to a review comment made by CodeRabbit. Example:
	- `I pushed a fix in commit <commit_id>.`
	- `Generate unit testing code for this file.`
	- `Open a follow-up GitHub issue for this discussion.`
- Files and specific lines of code (under the "Files changed" tab): Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new review comment at the desired location with your query. Examples:
	- `@coderabbitai generate unit testing code for this file.`
	-	`@coderabbitai modularize this function.`
- PR comments: Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new PR comment to ask questions about the PR branch. For the best results, please provide a very specific query, as very limited context is provided in this mode. Examples:
	- `@coderabbitai generate interesting stats about this repository and render them as a table.`
	- `@coderabbitai show all the console.log statements in this repository.`
	- `@coderabbitai read src/utils.ts and generate unit testing code.`
	- `@coderabbitai read the files in the src/scheduler package and generate a class diagram using mermaid and a README in the markdown format.`
	- `@coderabbitai help me debug CodeRabbit configuration file.`

Note: Be mindful of the bot's finite context window. It's strongly recommended to break down tasks such as reading entire modules into smaller chunks. For a focused discussion, use review comments to chat about specific files and their changes, instead of using the PR comments.

### CodeRabbit Commands (Invoked using PR comments)

- `@coderabbitai pause` to pause the reviews on a PR.
- `@coderabbitai resume` to resume the paused reviews.
- `@coderabbitai review` to trigger an incremental review. This is useful when automatic reviews are disabled for the repository.
- `@coderabbitai full review` to do a full review from scratch and review all the files again.
- `@coderabbitai summary` to regenerate the summary of the PR.
- `@coderabbitai resolve` resolve all the CodeRabbit review comments.
- `@coderabbitai configuration` to show the current CodeRabbit configuration for the repository.
- `@coderabbitai help` to get help.

### Other keywords and placeholders

- Add `@coderabbitai ignore` anywhere in the PR description to prevent this PR from being reviewed.
- Add `@coderabbitai summary` to generate the high-level summary at a specific location in the PR description.
- Add `@coderabbitai` anywhere in the PR title to generate the title automatically.

### Documentation and Community
