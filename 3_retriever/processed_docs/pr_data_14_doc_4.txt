## Walkthrough

The update involves integrating support for a new package manager named "bun" across various components of the application. This includes the addition of a `bun` option in the package managers' configuration, the introduction of a `BunIcon` for visual representation, and the inclusion of `bun` in the installation guide for NextUI. These changes collectively enhance the application's compatibility with different package management tools and enrich the UI with a new icon.

### PR Objectives

The pull request titled "Add bun as package manager eng 581" with the number 2625 aims to introduce support for a new package manager named "bun" into the NextUI project. This addition is detailed through modifications in several files, indicating a comprehensive integration of "bun" alongside existing package managers such as `npm`, `yarn`, and `pnpm`. The primary motivation behind this PR seems to be the enhancement of NextUI's compatibility and user accessibility by accommodating users of the "bun" package manager.

The description of the PR, although brief, is supplemented with a visual representation (an image link) presumably showcasing the integration or the update made. However, the specifics of the image or its contents are not directly described in the text provided. The PR does not explicitly mention the issue it closes, indicating that the description template's section for linking to a GitHub issue was not utilized.

The changes introduced by this PR are multi-faceted, involving updates to documentation, the addition of new icons, and the actual implementation of support for the "bun" package manager. Specifically, the `package-managers.tsx` file within the `apps/docs/components/docs/components/` directory has been updated to include "bun" as a supported package manager. This entails the declaration of a new package manager icon and the inclusion of "bun" in the `PackageManagerName` enum, signifying its official support within the NextUI ecosystem.

Furthermore, the `icons/social.tsx` file has been enriched with a new `BunIcon` component. This addition expands the icon library of the project, introducing a visually distinct icon that presumably represents the "bun" package manager, enhancing the UI/UX for users who prefer or use "bun" for their package management needs.

Lastly, the documentation, specifically the installation guide (`installation.mdx`), has been updated to include instructions for installing NextUI using the "bun" package manager. This update ensures that users are informed about the new installation method available to them, alongside the previously supported methods using `npm`, `yarn`, and `pnpm`.

### AI-generated Summary of Generated Summaries

The pull request introduces support for the "bun" package manager in the NextUI project, marking a significant update aimed at broadening the project's accessibility and compatibility with various package management tools. This integration is manifested through several key changes across the project's documentation, icon library, and component files. Specifically, the project's documentation now includes "bun" as an installation option, paralleling existing instructions for `npm`, `yarn`, and `pnpm`. This is complemented by the addition of a new `BunIcon` component within the `icons/social.tsx` file, visually representing the "bun" package manager and enhancing the project's icon library. Furthermore, the `package-managers.tsx` file has been updated to officially support "bun", including it in the `PackageManagerName` enum and ensuring its representation within the project's ecosystem. Collectively, these updates signify the project's commitment to inclusivity and support for a wider range of development tools and practices.

### Chat

There are 3 ways to chat with CodeRabbit:

- Review comments: Directly reply to a review comment made by CodeRabbit. Example:
	- `I pushed a fix in commit <commit_id>.`
	- `Generate unit testing code for this file.`
	- `Open a follow-up GitHub issue for this discussion.`
- Files and specific lines of code (under the "Files changed" tab): Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new review comment at the desired location with your query. Examples:
	- `@coderabbitai generate unit testing code for this file.`
	-	`@coderabbitai modularize this function.`
- PR comments: Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new PR comment to ask questions about the PR branch. For the best results, please provide a very specific query, as very limited context is provided in this mode. Examples:
	- `@coderabbitai generate interesting stats about this repository and render them as a table.`
	- `@coderabbitai show all the console.log statements in this repository.`
	- `@coderabbitai read src/utils.ts and generate unit testing code.`
	- `@coderabbitai read the files in the src/scheduler package and generate a class diagram using mermaid and a README in the markdown format.`

Note: Be mindful of the bot's finite context window. It's strongly recommended to break down tasks such as reading entire modules into smaller chunks. For a focused discussion, use review comments to chat about specific files and their changes, instead of using the PR comments.

### CodeRabbit Commands (invoked as PR comments)

- `@coderabbitai pause` to pause the reviews on a PR.
- `@coderabbitai resume` to resume the paused reviews.
- `@coderabbitai review` to trigger a review. This is useful when automatic reviews are disabled for the repository.
- `@coderabbitai resolve` resolve all the CodeRabbit review comments.
- `@coderabbitai help` to get help.


Additionally, you can add `@coderabbitai ignore` anywhere in the PR description to prevent this PR from being reviewed.

### CodeRabbit Configration File (`.coderabbit.yaml`)

- You can programmatically configure CodeRabbit by adding a `.coderabbit.yaml` file to the root of your repository.
- The JSON schema for the configuration file is available [here](https://coderabbit.ai/integrations/coderabbit-overrides.v2.json).
- If your editor has YAML language server enabled, you can add the path at the top of this file to enable auto-completion and validation: `# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://coderabbit.ai/integrations/coderabbit-overrides.v2.json`
