‚õ≥Ô∏è Current behavior (updates)
Since version 2.4.3, Select.onSelectionChange's arg has any type instead of Selection.
It has been touched here https://github.com/nextui-org/nextui/pull/3336/files
üöÄ New behavior
I believe this ensures type resolution when using next-ui with yarn pnp.
üí£ Is this a breaking change (No):

## Walkthrough

The `package.json` file in `packages/core/system-rsc` was updated to include a new dependency, `@react-types/shared` at version `3.23.1`. This update adds functionality by incorporating this new package while still retaining the existing dependency on `clsx` at version `^1.2.1`. No public or exported entities were altered as a result of this change.

## PR Summary

### Title
fix(system-rsc): add @react-types/shared to dependencies

### Description
The pull request addresses an issue in the `system-rsc` package of the NextUI project. The package `@react-types/shared` is being used in the `system-rsc` package, specifically in the `types.ts` file, but it was not listed as a dependency. This omission could cause issues with type resolution, especially when using NextUI with Yarn Plug'n'Play (PnP).

The current behavior since version 2.4.3 is that the `Select.onSelectionChange` argument has an `any` type instead of `Selection`. This was affected by changes made in a previous pull request (#3336).

The new behavior ensures proper type resolution by explicitly adding `@react-types/shared` to the dependencies of the `system-rsc` package. This change is not a breaking change.

<summary>Tips</summary>

### Chat

There are 3 ways to chat with [CodeRabbit](https://coderabbit.ai):

- Review comments: Directly reply to a review comment made by CodeRabbit. Example:
	- `I pushed a fix in commit <commit_id>.`
	- `Generate unit testing code for this file.`
	- `Open a follow-up GitHub issue for this discussion.`
- Files and specific lines of code (under the "Files changed" tab): Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new review comment at the desired location with your query. Examples:
	- `@coderabbitai generate unit testing code for this file.`
	-	`@coderabbitai modularize this function.`
- PR comments: Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new PR comment to ask questions about the PR branch. For the best results, please provide a very specific query, as very limited context is provided in this mode. Examples:
	- `@coderabbitai generate interesting stats about this repository and render them as a table.`
	- `@coderabbitai show all the console.log statements in this repository.`
	- `@coderabbitai read src/utils.ts and generate unit testing code.`
	- `@coderabbitai read the files in the src/scheduler package and generate a class diagram using mermaid and a README in the markdown format.`
	- `@coderabbitai help me debug CodeRabbit configuration file.`

Note: Be mindful of the bot's finite context window. It's strongly recommended to break down tasks such as reading entire modules into smaller chunks. For a focused discussion, use review comments to chat about specific files and their changes, instead of using the PR comments.

### CodeRabbit Commands (invoked as PR comments)

- `@coderabbitai pause` to pause the reviews on a PR.
- `@coderabbitai resume` to resume the paused reviews.
- `@coderabbitai review` to trigger an incremental review. This is useful when automatic reviews are disabled for the repository.
- `@coderabbitai full review` to do a full review from scratch and review all the files again.
- `@coderabbitai summary` to regenerate the summary of the PR.
- `@coderabbitai resolve` resolve all the CodeRabbit review comments.
- `@coderabbitai configuration` to show the current CodeRabbit configuration for the repository.
- `@coderabbitai help` to get help.


Additionally, you can add `@coderabbitai ignore` anywhere in the PR description to prevent this PR from being reviewed.

### CodeRabbit Configuration File (`.coderabbit.yaml`)

- You can programmatically configure CodeRabbit by adding a `.coderabbit.yaml` file to the root of your repository.
- Please see the [configuration documentation](https://docs.coderabbit.ai/guides/configure-coderabbit) for more information.
- If your editor has YAML language server enabled, you can add the path at the top of this file to enable auto-completion and validation: `# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://coderabbit.ai/integrations/schema.v2.json`
