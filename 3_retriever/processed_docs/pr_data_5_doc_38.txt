## Walkthrough

The pull request modifies the type signature of the `App` function's parameter from a specific `PaginationItemRenderProps<HTMLButtonElement>` to a more general `PaginationItemRenderProps`. This change simplifies the type definition while maintaining the existing logic for rendering pagination buttons. The core functionality of the component remains unchanged, ensuring that pagination behavior is preserved.

apps/docs/content/components/pagination/custom-items.ts: ## AI-generated summary of changes

The diff reflects a modification in the type signature of the `App` function's parameter from `PaginationItemRenderProps<HTMLButtonElement>` to `PaginationItemRenderProps`. This change indicates a shift from a specific type parameterization to a more general one, potentially broadening the applicability of the `PaginationItemRenderProps` type. The logic within the function remains unchanged, as it still handles the rendering of pagination buttons based on the `value` prop. The control flow continues to check for the `PaginationItemType.NEXT` condition and returns a button element accordingly. Overall, this change simplifies the type definition without altering the core functionality of the component.



## Alterations to the declarations of exported or public entities

### Chat

There are 3 ways to chat with [CodeRabbit](https://coderabbit.ai):

- Review comments: Directly reply to a review comment made by CodeRabbit. Example:
	- `I pushed a fix in commit <commit_id>.`
	- `Generate unit testing code for this file.`
	- `Open a follow-up GitHub issue for this discussion.`
- Files and specific lines of code (under the "Files changed" tab): Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new review comment at the desired location with your query. Examples:
	- `@coderabbitai generate unit testing code for this file.`
	-	`@coderabbitai modularize this function.`
- PR comments: Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new PR comment to ask questions about the PR branch. For the best results, please provide a very specific query, as very limited context is provided in this mode. Examples:
	- `@coderabbitai generate interesting stats about this repository and render them as a table.`
	- `@coderabbitai show all the console.log statements in this repository.`
	- `@coderabbitai read src/utils.ts and generate unit testing code.`
	- `@coderabbitai read the files in the src/scheduler package and generate a class diagram using mermaid and a README in the markdown format.`
	- `@coderabbitai help me debug CodeRabbit configuration file.`

Note: Be mindful of the bot's finite context window. It's strongly recommended to break down tasks such as reading entire modules into smaller chunks. For a focused discussion, use review comments to chat about specific files and their changes, instead of using the PR comments.

### CodeRabbit Commands (Invoked using PR comments)

- `@coderabbitai pause` to pause the reviews on a PR.
- `@coderabbitai resume` to resume the paused reviews.
- `@coderabbitai review` to trigger an incremental review. This is useful when automatic reviews are disabled for the repository.
- `@coderabbitai full review` to do a full review from scratch and review all the files again.
- `@coderabbitai summary` to regenerate the summary of the PR.
- `@coderabbitai resolve` resolve all the CodeRabbit review comments.
- `@coderabbitai configuration` to show the current CodeRabbit configuration for the repository.
- `@coderabbitai help` to get help.

### Other keywords and placeholders

- Add `@coderabbitai ignore` anywhere in the PR description to prevent this PR from being reviewed.
- Add `@coderabbitai summary` to generate the high-level summary at a specific location in the PR description.
- Add `@coderabbitai` anywhere in the PR title to generate the title automatically.
