üìù Description

Add a brief description

Adjust positioning of the widgets within floating components in the media queries large-to-2xl for improving ui and ux.
‚õ≥Ô∏è Current behavior (updates)

Please describe the current behavior that you are modifying

In the media queries large-to-2xl, the widgets are arranged in a different way, In addition, the image hides one of the features in the GridFeatures component (for this, only need to set z-index to the GridFeatures div) but I chose to offer a different arrangement for those media-queries, which might be suitable for you.
üöÄ New behavior

Please describe the behavior or changes this PR adds

Here is a demonstration video showing how it looks before and after. (on 1920x1080 display)
üí£ Is this a breaking change (Yes/No):

No.

## Walkthrough

The recent updates focus on enhancing the responsiveness of the `FloatingComponents` and `FloatingTabs` in the marketing section of the documentation app. By incorporating new responsive classes, the components now adjust their positioning, animations, and sizes based on screen size breakpoints, ensuring a more adaptable layout on larger screens.

## Changes

| File Path | Change Summary |
|-----------|----------------|
| `.../components/marketing/hero/floating-components.tsx` | Added responsive classes (`lg:max-2xl`) to adjust the positioning, animations, and sizes of components within the `FloatingComponents` React functional component for larger screens. |
| `.../components/marketing/hero/floating-tabs.tsx` | Modified the CSS class of the base element in `FloatingTabs` to include a responsive class for better positioning on larger screens. |

# Existing changesets

apps/docs/components/marketing/hero/floating-components.tsx: ## Short Summary
The changes in `apps/docs/components/marketing/hero/floating-components.tsx` involve adding responsive classes (`lg:max-2xl`) to adjust positioning and styling for different screen sizes. These changes impact the absolute positioning, animations, and sizes of various components within the `FloatingComponents` React functional component.

## Alterations to the declarations of exported or public entities
- `export const FloatingComponents: React.FC<{}> = () => {`
  - Updated classNames for `Switch`, `Input`, `Card`, `UserTwitterCard`, and `div` elements to include responsive classes for larger screens (`lg:max-2xl`).
  - Adjusted positioning and styling properties like top, right, width, height, and animation durations based on screen size breakpoints.

---

apps/docs/components/marketing/hero/floating-tabs.tsx: ## Short Summary
The change in functionality for `FloatingTabs` in `floating-tabs.tsx` involves adjusting the positioning of the tabs by modifying the CSS classes for the base element to include a new responsive class for larger screens.

## Alterations to the declarations of exported or public entities
- `export const FloatingTabs: React.FC<{}>` in `apps/docs/components/marketing/hero/floating-tabs.tsx`
  - Modified CSS class for the base element:
    - Before: `"absolute left-[170px] -top-[160px] h-10 animate-[levitate_17s_ease_infinite_1s]"`
    - After: `"absolute left-[170px] -top-[160px] h-10 animate-[levitate_17s_ease_infinite_1s] lg:max-2xl:-top-[100px]"`


# New changesets

apps/docs/components/marketing/hero/floating-components.tsx: ## AI-generated summary of changes

The changes in the `FloatingComponents` component primarily involve updates to the CSS class names applied to various elements, enhancing their responsiveness for larger screens (specifically targeting the `lg:max-2xl` breakpoint). The modifications include adjustments to positioning properties such as `top` and `right`, which are now conditionally altered based on the screen size. For instance, the `UserTwitterCard` and several `Card` components have updated `top` values to ensure better alignment and visibility on larger displays. The overall structure and functionality of the component remain unchanged, but the visual presentation is improved for different screen sizes, ensuring a more adaptive layout.

These changes reflect a focus on responsive design, allowing the `FloatingComponents` to maintain aesthetic integrity across various device sizes without altering the underlying logic or component behavior.



## Alterations to the declarations of exported or public entities

## PR Summary

**Title:** fix(app): adjust positioning of floating components  
**User:** ladunjexa  
**Number:** 3053  

**Description:**  
This pull request adjusts the positioning of widgets within floating components in the media queries for large-to-2xl screens to improve UI and UX. The current behavior has widgets arranged differently, and an image hides one of the features in the `GridFeatures` component. The proposed changes include setting the z-index for the `GridFeatures` div and offering a different arrangement for those media queries. A demonstration video is provided to show the before and after effects on a 1920x1080 display. This change is not a breaking change.

## Comments Summary

The comments on the pull request include feedback and requests for additional information from other contributors. 

1. **Request for Screenshots:**  
   User `ladunjexa` initially provided a demonstration video of the changes but was informed by another user that the video was not available. They were asked to attach before and after screenshots instead. In response, `ladunjexa` provided a new link to a video demonstrating the changes.

2. **Outdated Fork Concern:**  
   User `wingkwong` pointed out that `ladunjexa`'s forked repository was outdated, being one commit ahead but 183 commits behind the `nextui-org/nextui:canary` branch. They requested that `ladunjexa` sync their fork with the latest canary version to ensure the fix was still necessary and to facilitate a proper review of the pull request.

3. **Confirmation of Fix Requirement:**  
   In response to the concern about the outdated fork, `ladunjexa` confirmed that the fix was still required and mentioned that the video they uploaded was recorded recently. They also noted that the pull request had no conflicts and expressed confidence that it was ready to be merged.

4. **Final Sync Request:**  
   `wingkwong` reiterated the need for `ladunjexa` to sync their branch with the latest canary version before proceeding with the review of the pull request build.

Overall, the comments reflect a collaborative effort to ensure the pull request is up to date and ready for review, with a focus on maintaining the integrity of the codebase.

### Chat

There are 3 ways to chat with [CodeRabbit](https://coderabbit.ai):

- Review comments: Directly reply to a review comment made by CodeRabbit. Example:
	- `I pushed a fix in commit <commit_id>.`
	- `Generate unit testing code for this file.`
	- `Open a follow-up GitHub issue for this discussion.`
- Files and specific lines of code (under the "Files changed" tab): Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new review comment at the desired location with your query. Examples:
	- `@coderabbitai generate unit testing code for this file.`
	-	`@coderabbitai modularize this function.`
- PR comments: Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new PR comment to ask questions about the PR branch. For the best results, please provide a very specific query, as very limited context is provided in this mode. Examples:
	- `@coderabbitai generate interesting stats about this repository and render them as a table.`
	- `@coderabbitai show all the console.log statements in this repository.`
	- `@coderabbitai read src/utils.ts and generate unit testing code.`
	- `@coderabbitai read the files in the src/scheduler package and generate a class diagram using mermaid and a README in the markdown format.`
	- `@coderabbitai help me debug CodeRabbit configuration file.`

Note: Be mindful of the bot's finite context window. It's strongly recommended to break down tasks such as reading entire modules into smaller chunks. For a focused discussion, use review comments to chat about specific files and their changes, instead of using the PR comments.

My mistake, I thought I had already synced it yesterday. I just did. üëç\n- wingkwong: With width = 1920, the current documentation looks different than your video. Also We don't use max-2xl given the mobile first principle.
