Closes #2768
Closes #2775

üìù Description
In this PR, I solved the popover/dropdown open issue in production.
‚õ≥Ô∏è Current behavior (updates)

Popover/Dropdown is not opening. (In fact, it's open but it's at the very bottom so it will not show)

üöÄ New behavior

It is working as expected

üí£ Is this a breaking change (Yes/No):
No
üìù Additional Information
Hi,
Maintainer, Not sure exact flow for popover. But I do some console (in dev & prod). Getting that the ref is not passing to popover trigger, so it does not calculate the exact position of popover content.

Summary by CodeRabbit

Refactor

Enhanced PopoverTrigger component to seamlessly integrate with UI button features.

<!-- walkthrough_start -->

## Walkthrough
The update to the `PopoverTrigger` component involves enhancing its functionality by allowing the addition of a `ref` named `triggerRef` under certain conditions. This improvement is designed to work in conjunction with the existing `onPress` handler, providing more flexibility in managing the popover trigger element, especially when utilizing a custom trigger.

## Changes

| [BUG] - can't open dropdown in production (#2768)     | ‚ùì         | While the changes may indirectly impact dropdown functionality by improving trigger element handling, it's uncertain if this directly resolves the dropdown opening issue as the modifications do not directly address the reported problem. |

<!-- walkthrough_end --><!-- This is an auto-generated comment: raw summary by coderabbit.ai -->
<!--


packages/components/popover/src/popover-trigger.tsx: In the `PopoverTrigger` component, a `ref` named `triggerRef` is conditionally added to the props object when `hasNextUIButton` is true, alongside the existing `onPress` handler. Additionally, functionality has been added to allow adding a `ref` into a popover trigger element when using a custom trigger for it.

### PR Objectives (User Provided Facts)

**Title:** fix(popover): open issue in production

**PR Number:** 2773

**Description:**
The pull request addresses a bug where the popover/dropdown component was not functioning correctly in production environments. Specifically, the component appeared to be open but was rendered at the bottom of the page, making it invisible to users. The issue was identified in the NextUI library version 2.3.2 and was reported under issue #2768.

The developer has resolved the issue by ensuring that a `ref` (reference) is correctly passed to the `PopoverTrigger` component. This `ref` is crucial for calculating the position of the popover content on the page. The fix involves conditionally adding a `triggerRef` to the props of the `PopoverTrigger` when `hasNextUIButton` is true, which was not happening previously. This adjustment ensures that the popover/dropdown now appears in the correct position when activated.

**Linked Issue (#2768):**
The linked issue describes a bug where dropdowns could not be opened in production. The problem was reproducible on the official NextUI documentation site, indicating a widespread issue affecting all users of the library in production environments. The issue included a screenshot and detailed steps for reproducing the bug, highlighting its impact on user experience across different platforms and browsers.

### Comments Summary

- Developers discussed testing methodologies and issues encountered post-upgrade to version 2.3.3, noting problems with popover display at the bottom of the screen.
- Concerns were raised about using non-NextUI elements in `DropdownTrigger` affecting menu visibility even after the PR changes.
- A user reported experiencing the popover display issue on the NextUI documentation page, emphasizing the persistence of the problem across different contexts.

### AI-Generated Summary of Generated Summaries

The PR addresses the popover/dropdown visibility issue in production by enhancing the `PopoverTrigger` component in the NextUI library. It introduces a conditional addition of a `triggerRef` to the component's props, ensuring the correct positioning of popover content.

### Chat

There are 3 ways to chat with [CodeRabbit](https://coderabbit.ai):

- Review comments: Directly reply to a review comment made by CodeRabbit. Example:
	- `I pushed a fix in commit <commit_id>.`
	- `Generate unit testing code for this file.`
	- `Open a follow-up GitHub issue for this discussion.`
- Files and specific lines of code (under the "Files changed" tab): Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new review comment at the desired location with your query. Examples:
	- `@coderabbitai generate unit testing code for this file.`
	-	`@coderabbitai modularize this function.`
- PR comments: Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new PR comment to ask questions about the PR branch. For the best results, please provide a very specific query, as very limited context is provided in this mode. Examples:
	- `@coderabbitai generate interesting stats about this repository and render them as a table.`
	- `@coderabbitai show all the console.log statements in this repository.`
	- `@coderabbitai read src/utils.ts and generate unit testing code.`
	- `@coderabbitai read the files in the src/scheduler package and generate a class diagram using mermaid and a README in the markdown format.`

Note: Be mindful of the bot's finite context window. It's strongly recommended to break down tasks such as reading entire modules into smaller chunks. For a focused discussion, use review comments to chat about specific files and their changes, instead of using the PR comments.

@wingkwong I'm experiencing the same issue after upgrading to 2.3.3. Popover is displayed at the bottom of the screen. Even on the docs page. [Docs](https://nextui.org/docs/components/popover)\n- wingkwong: @lightify97 Sorry for confusion. To be exact, I was asking for dropdown one as I couldn't reproduce locally. That's why I'm asking how to test before this PR change.

For popover one, I could reproduce the issue locally and I agree that it was due to the missing ref.\n- withden: Hi @wingkwong ,

I build docs locally and serve locally (production build). There it's working.

Also, I checked the current production: https://nextui-storybook-v2-3607p8e38-nextui-org.vercel.app/ It's working (Popover & Dropdown)

For 3rd commit: It's working with a custom component (Just a `<div>Test</div>`. I attached the picture of local build of nextui docs

\n- wingkwong: @withden can you double check the popover in docs? Clicking the one in Usage:

\n- wingkwong: @withden The screenshot I posted was taken from your PR. I ran it locally with your changes.\n- withden: @wingkwong 

Yes, I see that issue. It's only with left & right placement issues. 

You can check all placements are working in the storybook: https://nextui-storybook-v2-oijrysltx-nextui-org.vercel.app/?path=/story/components-popover--placements

It's more specific to docs/. When I try the same code in the nextui docs it's working fine with `right` placement. (In docs build)

\n- wingkwong: @withden can you also try to fix the doc one? It's not expected to click it and the popover shows somewhere in the page.\n- wingkwong: Closing - covered in [here](https://github.com/nextui-org/nextui/commit/9e5dd8ce37c94c9ca1ba7b2049a6e55f1803fee9)\n- lightify97: @wingkwong Some of the popovers are still not correctly displayed in the right position. Especially if lateral direction is specified. Can be confirmed on the docs page.

\n- wingkwong: @lightify97 If you are only talking about the docs one, I already have created a new issue. That one seems related to the docs instead of popover. If not, please share your code.\n
