### PR Objectives (User Provided Facts)

The pull request, numbered 2545, focuses on enhancing the documentation related to the `Space` type within a specific markdown file (`spacer.mdx`). The primary objective of this PR is to reorder the values associated with the `Space` type into a logical ascending sequence, such as 0.5, 1, 1.5, etc. This reordering is aimed at improving the readability and consistency of the documentation, making it easier for users to understand and follow the specified values for `Space`. The PR explicitly mentions that these changes are confined to the documentation level and do not have any functional impact on the codebase itself. Additionally, it is noted that the value `2` has been removed from the `Space` type as part of the reordering process. This action suggests an effort to streamline the available options for `Space` to better align with the newly established logical sequence.

### AI-Generated Summary of Generated Summaries

The documentation for the `Space` type within the `spacer.mdx` file has been updated to enhance clarity and consistency. Specifically, the values associated with the `Space` type have been reordered into a logical ascending sequence, and the value `2` has been removed from the list. These adjustments are aimed at improving the readability of the documentation by presenting the `Space` type values in a more intuitive and structured manner. This change is strictly documentation-related and does not affect the functional aspects of the code.

### Chat

There are 3 ways to chat with CodeRabbit:

- Review comments: Directly reply to a review comment made by CodeRabbit. Example:
	- `I pushed a fix in commit <commit_id>.`
	- `Generate unit-tests for this file.`
	- `Open a follow-up GitHub issue for this discussion.`
- Files and specific lines of code (under the "Files changed" tab): Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new review comment at the desired location with your query. Examples:
	- `@coderabbitai generate unit tests for this file.`
	-	`@coderabbitai modularize this function.`
- PR comments: Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new PR comment to ask questions about the PR branch. For the best results, please provide a very specific query, as very limited context is provided in this mode. Examples:
	- `@coderabbitai generate interesting stats about this repository and render them as a table.`
	- `@coderabbitai show all the console.log statements in this repository.`
	- `@coderabbitai read src/utils.ts and generate unit tests.`
	- `@coderabbitai read the files in the src/scheduler package and generate a class diagram using mermaid and a README in the markdown format.`

Note: Be mindful of the bot's finite context window. It's strongly recommended to break down tasks such as reading entire modules into smaller chunks. For a focused discussion, use review comments to chat about specific files and their changes, instead of using the PR comments.

### CodeRabbit Commands (invoked as PR comments)
