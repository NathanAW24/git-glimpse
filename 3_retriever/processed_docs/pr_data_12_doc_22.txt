\n- coderabbitai: <!-- This is an auto-generated comment: summarize by coderabbit.ai -->
<!-- walkthrough_start -->

## Walkthrough
The updates primarily focus on restructuring exports across several Next.js UI-related packages to transition from using wildcard exports to named exports. This change enhances clarity, modularity, and compatibility with environments that require explicit exports.

## Assessment against linked issues

| Objective                                                              | Addressed | Explanation |

| Resolve "export *" unsupported error in client boundary (#2749, #2756, #2777, #2785) | ‚úÖ         |             |

## Possibly related issues
- **Issue #2756**: The changes address the bug related to using "export *" in a client boundary by introducing named exports.
- **Issue #2777**: Similar to #2756, this issue is addressed by the transition to named exports which resolves the compilation error.
- **Issue #2785**: This issue, which involves a build failure due to the use of "export *", is directly addressed by the restructuring of exports in the PR.

<!-- walkthrough_end --><!-- This is an auto-generated comment: raw summary by coderabbit.ai -->
<!--


.changeset/sharp-planes-reply.md: The new file introduces named exports for several Next.js UI-related packages, including `@nextui-org/react`, `@nextui-org/system`, `@nextui-org/aria-utils`, `@nextui-org/framer-utils`, and `@nextui-org/react-utils`.

---

packages/core/react/tsup.config.ts: The change in functionality involves the removal of the `banner` configuration option from the `tsup` configuration in the `tsup.config.ts` file.

---

packages/core/system/src/index.ts: The changes in functionality involve reorganizing the exports in the `index.ts` file, introducing new type exports and redefining exports from an external module. The file now exports specific types from an external module, reexports selected functions, and exports types related to provider and provider context.

---

packages/utilities/aria-utils/src/collections/index.ts: The change in functionality involves restructuring the exports in the `collections/index.ts` file to explicitly export specific types and base classes instead of exporting everything from individual files.

---

packages/utilities/aria-utils/src/index.ts: The functionality changes in the `index.ts` file involve reorganizing the exports to explicitly export specific types and functions from various modules related to collections, overlays, and utilities. The exports now include individual type exports from `type-utils`, specific props from `collections`, key functions from `utils`, and a set of utility functions related to overlays.

---

packages/utilities/aria-utils/src/overlays/index.ts: The functionality change in the `index.ts` file involves restructuring the exports to specifically export types from the `types` module and individual functions from the `utils` module, while exporting `ariaHideOutside` separately.

---

packages/utilities/framer-utils/src/index.ts: The functionality change involves restructuring the exports in the `index.ts` file to explicitly export types and constants from `transition-utils` and `resizable-panel`, enhancing clarity and organization.

---

packages/utilities/react-utils/src/index.ts: The changes in functionality involve restructuring the exports in the `react-utils` package. The update introduces type exports for specific entities and reorganizes the exports for better clarity and separation of concerns.

### PR Objectives

**Title:** fix(core): export * from not supported on client components

**Description:** This pull request aims to fix a bug reported in issue #2749 within the NextUI project, where the use of "export *" in a client boundary caused compilation errors. The PR introduces named exports in place of wildcard exports across various UI-related packages to enhance modularity and usability in Next.js projects. Additionally, it optimizes exports in utility packages for clearer structure and removes unnecessary build configuration options to streamline development.

**Linked Issue (#2749):** The issue highlights a bug in NextUI version 2.3.1 where using "export *" in a client boundary led to compilation errors, specifically in the `@nextui-org/react-utils` package. The user's manual removal of the problematic export resolved the issue, indicating a need for a revised export approach.

### AI-Generated Summary of Generated Summaries

This pull request implements significant changes in the NextUI project to address the compilation issue caused by unsupported wildcard exports in client boundaries. The key alterations focus on transitioning from wildcard exports to named exports across multiple packages to enhance code modularity and maintainability.

1. **Core Package Changes:**
   - The `tsup.config.ts` file removes the `banner` configuration option, simplifying the build process.
   - In `system/src/index.ts`, exports are reorganized to include new type exports and specific reexports from external modules, improving clarity and specificity in module interactions.

2. **Utilities Package Changes:**
   - Updates in `aria-utils` packages like `collections/index.ts` and `overlays/index.ts` explicitly export specific types and functions, enhancing clarity and encapsulation.
   - Changes in `framer-utils/src/index.ts` and `react-utils/src/index.ts` focus on organizing and explicitly exporting types and utilities to improve export clarity and reduce potential errors.

These modifications collectively aim to resolve the issue of unsupported wildcard exports in client boundaries by transitioning to a more controlled and clear export structure. This not only addresses the immediate compilation errors but also enhances code quality and maintainability in the NextUI project.

<summary>Tips</summary>

### Chat

There are 3 ways to chat with [CodeRabbit](https://coderabbit.ai):

- Review comments: Directly reply to a review comment made by CodeRabbit. Example:
	- `I pushed a fix in commit <commit_id>.`
	- `Generate unit testing code for this file.`
	- `Open a follow-up GitHub issue for this discussion.`
- Files and specific lines of code (under the "Files changed" tab): Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new review comment at the desired location with your query. Examples:
	- `@coderabbitai generate unit testing code for this file.`
	-	`@coderabbitai modularize this function.`
- PR comments: Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new PR comment to ask questions about the PR branch. For the best results, please provide a very specific query, as very limited context is provided in this mode. Examples:
	- `@coderabbitai generate interesting stats about this repository and render them as a table.`
	- `@coderabbitai show all the console.log statements in this repository.`
	- `@coderabbitai read src/utils.ts and generate unit testing code.`
	- `@coderabbitai read the files in the src/scheduler package and generate a class diagram using mermaid and a README in the markdown format.`

Note: Be mindful of the bot's finite context window. It's strongly recommended to break down tasks such as reading entire modules into smaller chunks. For a focused discussion, use review comments to chat about specific files and their changes, instead of using the PR comments.

### CodeRabbit Commands (invoked as PR comments)

- `@coderabbitai pause` to pause the reviews on a PR.
- `@coderabbitai resume` to resume the paused reviews.
- `@coderabbitai review` to trigger a review. This is useful when automatic reviews are disabled for the repository.
- `@coderabbitai resolve` resolve all the CodeRabbit review comments.
- `@coderabbitai help` to get help.


Additionally, you can add `@coderabbitai ignore` anywhere in the PR description to prevent this PR from being reviewed.

### CodeRabbit Configration File (`.coderabbit.yaml`)

- You can programmatically configure CodeRabbit by adding a `.coderabbit.yaml` file to the root of your repository.
- Please see the [configuration documentation](https://docs.coderabbit.ai/guides/configure-coderabbit) for more information.
- If your editor has YAML language server enabled, you can add the path at the top of this file to enable auto-completion and validation: `# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://coderabbit.ai/integrations/schema.v2.json`

### Documentation and Community
