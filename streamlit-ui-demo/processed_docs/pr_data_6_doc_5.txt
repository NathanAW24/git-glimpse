packages/core/theme/src/components/select.ts: ## AI-generated summary of changes

This update introduces modifications to the `select` component's styling configuration within the `packages/core/theme/src/components/select.ts` file. A new style rule for the `value` property has been added in the `default` state, setting it to `"group-data-[has-value=true]:text-default-foreground"`. Additionally, the existing `label` property in the `underlined` state has been changed to `value`, now also set to `"group-data-[has-value=true]:text-default-foreground"`. These changes correct the color of the selected value from `text-foreground-500` to `text-default-foreground`, ensuring that the selected state visually aligns with expected design standards. The modifications enhance the overall appearance and usability of the component, improving user interaction cues and providing clearer visual feedback.

## PR Summary

The pull request titled "fix(theme): color discrepancy in select" addresses a bug identified in issue #3659 concerning the color of the selected value and label in the SELECT component of the NextUI library. The current behavior shows that when a value is selected in both the Bordered and Underline variants of the SELECT component, the color remains `text-foreground-500`, leading to visual inconsistency. This PR proposes a solution that changes the color to `text-default-foreground` upon selection, ensuring that the label color adjusts according to the specified `color` variant. Screenshots included in the PR illustrate the changes in color for both variants, demonstrating improved visual consistency when a selection is made. The modifications specifically target the `value` slot in both the Bordered and Underline variants, enhancing the overall user experience.

## Objectives from Linked Issues

The linked issue #3659 describes a bug where the font color in the Bordered SELECT component remains gray, regardless of the `color` prop set by the user. This inconsistency is problematic, as the font color in the Input component appears black while the SELECT component's font color remains gray. The issue was reported by a user who provided an example of the Bordered SELECT component with the `color="primary"` prop, which did not change the font color as expected. The user anticipated that the font color would align with the selected color variant, highlighting the need for a fix to ensure that the SELECT component behaves consistently with other input components. The objective is to resolve this inconsistency in font color and provide a mechanism for users to effectively change the color in the SELECT component.

## Comments Summary

The comments on the PR primarily consist of a request from user `wingkwong` asking the PR author, `macci001`, to direct message them on Discord, using the same username. No additional feedback or discussions regarding the changes made in the PR were provided in the comments section. This indicates that the focus of the interaction was on private communication rather than public review or critique of the proposed changes. As such, there are no further insights or discussions about the implementation or potential improvements to the PR at this time. The absence of comments may suggest either a lack of immediate concern from other contributors or that the changes were straightforward and aligned with the expectations set by the linked issue.

### Chat

There are 3 ways to chat with [CodeRabbit](https://coderabbit.ai):

- Review comments: Directly reply to a review comment made by CodeRabbit. Example:
	- `I pushed a fix in commit <commit_id>.`
	- `Generate unit testing code for this file.`
	- `Open a follow-up GitHub issue for this discussion.`
- Files and specific lines of code (under the "Files changed" tab): Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new review comment at the desired location with your query. Examples:
	- `@coderabbitai generate unit testing code for this file.`
	-	`@coderabbitai modularize this function.`
- PR comments: Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new PR comment to ask questions about the PR branch. For the best results, please provide a very specific query, as very limited context is provided in this mode. Examples:
	- `@coderabbitai generate interesting stats about this repository and render them as a table.`
	- `@coderabbitai show all the console.log statements in this repository.`
	- `@coderabbitai read src/utils.ts and generate unit testing code.`
	- `@coderabbitai read the files in the src/scheduler package and generate a class diagram using mermaid and a README in the markdown format.`
	- `@coderabbitai help me debug CodeRabbit configuration file.`

Note: Be mindful of the bot's finite context window. It's strongly recommended to break down tasks such as reading entire modules into smaller chunks. For a focused discussion, use review comments to chat about specific files and their changes, instead of using the PR comments.

### CodeRabbit Commands (invoked as PR comments)

- `@coderabbitai pause` to pause the reviews on a PR.
- `@coderabbitai resume` to resume the paused reviews.
- `@coderabbitai review` to trigger an incremental review. This is useful when automatic reviews are disabled for the repository.
- `@coderabbitai full review` to do a full review from scratch and review all the files again.
