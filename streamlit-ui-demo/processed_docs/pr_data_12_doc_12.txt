## Walkthrough
The recent updates focus on enhancing date handling in the date range picker components by integrating functions from `@internationalized/date`. These changes involve adding specific date-related utilities to improve timezone and date-time parsing capabilities, ensuring more robust and accurate date manipulation within the components.

## Changes

### PR Objectives

The pull request titled "fix(docs): imports missing in DateRangePicker" with number 2811 aims to address missing imports in the documentation examples for the `DateRangePicker` component. Specifically, the PR updates the import statements in two examples: **_Controlled_** and **_With Time Fields_**.

In the **_Controlled_** example, the existing import statement only includes `parseDate` from the `@internationalized/date` package. The PR proposes to add `getLocalTimeZone` to this import, thereby enhancing the functionality related to handling local time zones in date operations.

For the **_With Time Fields_** example, the PR introduces a new import for `parseZonedDateTime` from the `@internationalized/date` package. This addition is intended to support the parsing of date and time information in a timezone-aware manner, which is crucial for correctly handling date inputs that include time information.

The PR does not specify any linked issues that it closes, nor does it indicate whether these changes are breaking changes. Additional information section is left blank, suggesting that no further context or explanation was deemed necessary by the author.

### AI-Generated Summary of Generated Summaries

The pull request enhances the functionality of the `DateRangePicker` documentation by updating import statements in two specific examples. In the **_Controlled_** example, it adds `getLocalTimeZone` to the existing import of `parseDate` from `@internationalized/date`, facilitating improved local timezone handling. In the **_With Time Fields_** example, it introduces an import for `parseZonedDateTime` from the same package, enabling the parsing of zoned date and time data. These updates ensure that the examples in the documentation are more comprehensive and functional, addressing previously missing capabilities in handling date and time data accurately.

### Chat

There are 3 ways to chat with [CodeRabbit](https://coderabbit.ai):

- Review comments: Directly reply to a review comment made by CodeRabbit. Example:
	- `I pushed a fix in commit <commit_id>.`
	- `Generate unit testing code for this file.`
	- `Open a follow-up GitHub issue for this discussion.`
- Files and specific lines of code (under the "Files changed" tab): Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new review comment at the desired location with your query. Examples:
	- `@coderabbitai generate unit testing code for this file.`
	-	`@coderabbitai modularize this function.`
- PR comments: Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new PR comment to ask questions about the PR branch. For the best results, please provide a very specific query, as very limited context is provided in this mode. Examples:
	- `@coderabbitai generate interesting stats about this repository and render them as a table.`
	- `@coderabbitai show all the console.log statements in this repository.`
	- `@coderabbitai read src/utils.ts and generate unit testing code.`
	- `@coderabbitai read the files in the src/scheduler package and generate a class diagram using mermaid and a README in the markdown format.`

Note: Be mindful of the bot's finite context window. It's strongly recommended to break down tasks such as reading entire modules into smaller chunks. For a focused discussion, use review comments to chat about specific files and their changes, instead of using the PR comments.

### CodeRabbit Commands (invoked as PR comments)

- `@coderabbitai pause` to pause the reviews on a PR.
- `@coderabbitai resume` to resume the paused reviews.
- `@coderabbitai review` to trigger a review. This is useful when automatic reviews are disabled for the repository.
- `@coderabbitai resolve` resolve all the CodeRabbit review comments.
- `@coderabbitai help` to get help.


Additionally, you can add `@coderabbitai ignore` anywhere in the PR description to prevent this PR from being reviewed.

### CodeRabbit Configration File (`.coderabbit.yaml`)
