## Walkthrough

This update introduces dependencies on `@nextui-org/skeleton` and `@nextui-org/theme` to address a bug where the skeleton component did not respect the `disableAnimation` property. Additionally, it involves the removal of the `defaultVariants` property from the skeleton component, streamlining its functionality and ensuring animations can be disabled as expected.

### PR Objectives

This Pull Request (PR) aims to fix a bug in the NextUI library related to the `Skeleton` component's handling of the `disableAnimation` property. The PR, numbered 2538 and titled "fix(skeleton): missing disableAnimation behaviour in skeleton," addresses issue #2537, where the `Skeleton` component fails to stop its animation despite the `disableAnimation` prop being set. The goal is to align the `Skeleton` component's behavior with expectations, ensuring that setting `disableAnimation` results in halting the animation to display a static skeleton state.

The PR description highlights the intention to correct the current behavior of the `Skeleton` component, focusing on enabling custom variants to override default variants properly. The linked issue #2537 provides detailed steps to reproduce the bug, expected behavior, and the environment where the issue was encountered (NextUI version 2.2.9, MacOS, Chrome browser).

The code diff summaries indicate changes in the `@nextui-org/skeleton` and `@nextui-org/theme` packages, notably removing the `defaultVariants` property from the `skeleton` component in `packages/core/theme/src/components/skeleton.ts`. This change suggests a direct adjustment to ensure the `Skeleton` component respects the `disableAnimation` property as intended.

### AI-generated Summary of Generated Summaries

PR #2538 addresses a bug in the NextUI library's `Skeleton` component where the `disableAnimation` property did not function correctly. Issue #2537 reported that despite setting `disableAnimation`, the animations within the `Skeleton` component continued to play, contrary to expectations. The bug was identified in NextUI version 2.2.9 on MacOS using the Chrome browser.

The fix involves changes to the `@nextui-org/skeleton` and `@nextui-org/theme` packages, notably removing the `defaultVariants` property from the `skeleton` component's configuration. This adjustment aims to ensure that the `Skeleton` component interprets and applies the `disableAnimation` property correctly, aligning its behavior with the expected static skeleton state when animations are disabled.

By addressing the discrepancy in animation control, this PR enhances the usability and reliability of the `Skeleton` component in the NextUI library. The removal of the `defaultVariants` property signifies a focused approach to resolving the issue, emphasizing proper handling of the `disableAnimation` property within the component's configuration.

### Chat

There are 3 ways to chat with CodeRabbit:

- Review comments: Directly reply to a review comment made by CodeRabbit. Example:
	- `I pushed a fix in commit <commit_id>.`
	- `Generate unit-tests for this file.`
	- `Open a follow-up GitHub issue for this discussion.`
- Files and specific lines of code (under the "Files changed" tab): Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new review comment at the desired location with your query. Examples:
	- `@coderabbitai generate unit tests for this file.`
	-	`@coderabbitai modularize this function.`
- PR comments: Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new PR comment to ask questions about the PR branch. For the best results, please provide a very specific query, as very limited context is provided in this mode. Examples:
	- `@coderabbitai generate interesting stats about this repository and render them as a table.`
	- `@coderabbitai show all the console.log statements in this repository.`
	- `@coderabbitai read src/utils.ts and generate unit tests.`
	- `@coderabbitai read the files in the src/scheduler package and generate a class diagram using mermaid and a README in the markdown format.`

Note: Be mindful of the bot's finite context window. It's strongly recommended to break down tasks such as reading entire modules into smaller chunks. For a focused discussion, use review comments to chat about specific files and their changes, instead of using the PR comments.

### CodeRabbit Commands (invoked as PR comments)

- `@coderabbitai pause` to pause the reviews on a PR.
- `@coderabbitai resume` to resume the paused reviews.
- `@coderabbitai review` to trigger a review. This is useful when automatic reviews are disabled for the repository.
- `@coderabbitai resolve` resolve all the CodeRabbit review comments.
- `@coderabbitai help` to get help.


Additionally, you can add `@coderabbitai ignore` anywhere in the PR description to prevent this PR from being reviewed.

### CodeRabbit Configration File (`.coderabbit.yaml`)

- You can programmatically configure CodeRabbit by adding a `.coderabbit.yaml` file to the root of your repository.
- The JSON schema for the configuration file is available [here](https://coderabbit.ai/integrations/coderabbit-overrides.v2.json).
- If your editor has YAML language server enabled, you can add the path at the top of this file to enable auto-completion and validation: `# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://coderabbit.ai/integrations/coderabbit-overrides.v2.json`
