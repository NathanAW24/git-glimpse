## Walkthrough

The pull request modifies the `Navbar` component in the `navbar.tsx` file by updating the `href` attribute and `onClick` handler for a navigation link. The link previously directed users to the "/docs/components/avatar" page and now directs to the "/docs/components/accordion" page. This change alters the navigation flow within the application without affecting the overall structure or logic of the `Navbar` component.

apps/docs/components/navbar.tsx: ## AI-generated summary of changes

The diff reflects a modification in the `Navbar` component's functionality within the `navbar.tsx` file. Specifically, the `href` attribute and the `onClick` handler for a navigation link have been updated to point to a new route. The previous link directed users to the "/docs/components/avatar" page, while the updated link now directs to the "/docs/components/accordion" page. This change alters the navigation flow, ensuring that when users interact with the "Components" link, they are taken to the accordion documentation instead of the avatar documentation. The overall structure and logic of the `Navbar` component remain intact, but the specific destination for one of the navigation items has been changed.



## Alterations to the declarations of exported or public entities

- No changes to the declarations of exported or public entities were made in `apps/docs/components/navbar.tsx`.

## PR Summary

The pull request titled "chore(docs): update component link" was submitted by the user wingkwong and is identified by the number 3737. The primary purpose of this PR is to update the navigation link in the documentation for the components section. 

Currently, when users click on the "component" link in the navbar of the documentation, it directs them to the "avatar" component. However, this component is no longer the first component in the list. The proposed change aims to redirect users to the "accordion" component, which is now the first component in the documentation.

The PR does not introduce any new external dependencies and is focused solely on correcting the navigation behavior within the documentation. There is no indication that this change will result in any breaking changes for existing users of NextUI. 

Overall, this update is intended to improve the user experience by ensuring that the documentation accurately reflects the current order of components.

### Chat

There are 3 ways to chat with [CodeRabbit](https://coderabbit.ai):

- Review comments: Directly reply to a review comment made by CodeRabbit. Example:
	- `I pushed a fix in commit <commit_id>.`
	- `Generate unit testing code for this file.`
	- `Open a follow-up GitHub issue for this discussion.`
- Files and specific lines of code (under the "Files changed" tab): Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new review comment at the desired location with your query. Examples:
	- `@coderabbitai generate unit testing code for this file.`
	-	`@coderabbitai modularize this function.`
- PR comments: Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new PR comment to ask questions about the PR branch. For the best results, please provide a very specific query, as very limited context is provided in this mode. Examples:
	- `@coderabbitai generate interesting stats about this repository and render them as a table.`
	- `@coderabbitai show all the console.log statements in this repository.`
	- `@coderabbitai read src/utils.ts and generate unit testing code.`
	- `@coderabbitai read the files in the src/scheduler package and generate a class diagram using mermaid and a README in the markdown format.`
	- `@coderabbitai help me debug CodeRabbit configuration file.`

Note: Be mindful of the bot's finite context window. It's strongly recommended to break down tasks such as reading entire modules into smaller chunks. For a focused discussion, use review comments to chat about specific files and their changes, instead of using the PR comments.

### CodeRabbit Commands (Invoked using PR comments)

- `@coderabbitai pause` to pause the reviews on a PR.
- `@coderabbitai resume` to resume the paused reviews.
- `@coderabbitai review` to trigger an incremental review. This is useful when automatic reviews are disabled for the repository.
- `@coderabbitai full review` to do a full review from scratch and review all the files again.
- `@coderabbitai summary` to regenerate the summary of the PR.
- `@coderabbitai resolve` resolve all the CodeRabbit review comments.
- `@coderabbitai configuration` to show the current CodeRabbit configuration for the repository.
- `@coderabbitai help` to get help.

### Other keywords and placeholders

- Add `@coderabbitai ignore` anywhere in the PR description to prevent this PR from being reviewed.
- Add `@coderabbitai summary` to generate the high-level summary at a specific location in the PR description.
