<!-- walkthrough_start -->

## Walkthrough
The updates involve removing imports from `@internationalized/date` and adjusting imports for `DatePicker` from `@nextui-org/react` across several DatePicker component files. These changes suggest a shift away from the `@internationalized/date` package for date handling, possibly in favor of another method integrated within `@nextui-org/react` or elsewhere.

## Changes

| Files | Changes |
|-------|---------|
| `.../date-picker/description.ts`, `error-message.ts`, `readonly.ts`, `required.ts` | Removed `CalendarDate` import from `@internationalized/date`. Adjusted `DatePicker` import from `@nextui-org/react`. |
| `.../date-picker/disabled.ts`, `min-and-max-date.ts` | Removed imports of `CalendarDate` and `parseDate` from `@internationalized/date`. |

### PR Objectives

The pull request (PR) number 2840 titled "fix(docs): removed unused imports from DatePicker" focuses on cleaning up the codebase by removing unused imports from various files associated with the DatePicker component. The specific files affected include those handling descriptions, disabled states, error messages, minimum and maximum dates, readonly states, and required fields. The PR does not specify any issues it closes, suggesting it is primarily a maintenance update to improve code quality and efficiency.

The description indicates that the changes are confined to the removal of unnecessary import statements, which should not alter the functionality of the DatePicker component. This implies that the update is not expected to introduce any breaking changes. The contributor has requested that if the PR is accepted, their GitHub email should be used in the co-authored-by commit message, indicating a preference for how they wish to be credited for their contribution.

### AI-Generated Summary of Generated Summaries

In the pull request, unused import statements related to date handling and component usage were removed from several files within the DatePicker documentation. Specifically, the import of `CalendarDate` from `@internationalized/date` was removed from files handling descriptions, error messages, readonly states, and required fields. Additionally, adjustments were made to the import statements for `DatePicker` from `@nextui-org/react` to streamline the code. In files dealing with disabled states and defining minimum and maximum dates, imports for both `CalendarDate` and `parseDate` from `@internationalized/date` were removed, further cleaning up the codebase. These changes contribute to a cleaner and more efficient code structure without affecting the overall functionality of the DatePicker component.

<summary>Tips</summary>

### Chat

There are 3 ways to chat with [CodeRabbit](https://coderabbit.ai):

- Review comments: Directly reply to a review comment made by CodeRabbit. Example:
	- `I pushed a fix in commit <commit_id>.`
	- `Generate unit testing code for this file.`
	- `Open a follow-up GitHub issue for this discussion.`
- Files and specific lines of code (under the "Files changed" tab): Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new review comment at the desired location with your query. Examples:
	- `@coderabbitai generate unit testing code for this file.`
	-	`@coderabbitai modularize this function.`
- PR comments: Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new PR comment to ask questions about the PR branch. For the best results, please provide a very specific query, as very limited context is provided in this mode. Examples:
	- `@coderabbitai generate interesting stats about this repository and render them as a table.`
	- `@coderabbitai show all the console.log statements in this repository.`
	- `@coderabbitai read src/utils.ts and generate unit testing code.`
	- `@coderabbitai read the files in the src/scheduler package and generate a class diagram using mermaid and a README in the markdown format.`

Note: Be mindful of the bot's finite context window. It's strongly recommended to break down tasks such as reading entire modules into smaller chunks. For a focused discussion, use review comments to chat about specific files and their changes, instead of using the PR comments.

### CodeRabbit Commands (invoked as PR comments)

- `@coderabbitai pause` to pause the reviews on a PR.
- `@coderabbitai resume` to resume the paused reviews.
- `@coderabbitai review` to trigger a review. This is useful when automatic reviews are disabled for the repository.
- `@coderabbitai resolve` resolve all the CodeRabbit review comments.
- `@coderabbitai help` to get help.


Additionally, you can add `@coderabbitai ignore` anywhere in the PR description to prevent this PR from being reviewed.

### CodeRabbit Configration File (`.coderabbit.yaml`)

- You can programmatically configure CodeRabbit by adding a `.coderabbit.yaml` file to the root of your repository.
- Please see the [configuration documentation](https://docs.coderabbit.ai/guides/configure-coderabbit) for more information.
- If your editor has YAML language server enabled, you can add the path at the top of this file to enable auto-completion and validation: `# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://coderabbit.ai/integrations/schema.v2.json`
