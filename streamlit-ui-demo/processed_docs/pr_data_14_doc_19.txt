## Walkthrough

This update primarily focuses on upgrading the `turbo` package from version 1.6.3 to 1.13.0, as reflected in both `package.json` and `pnpm-lock.yaml`. Additionally, it involves a configuration change in `turbo.json`, where the `baseBranch` declaration has been removed. These changes suggest an effort to keep the project's dependencies up to date and a possible shift in the configuration strategy for turbo builds.

### PR Objectives

This Pull Request (PR) focuses on updating the `turbo` package within a project, as indicated by the title "chore(deps): bump turbo" and the PR number 2592. The description and the changes made in the PR suggest an effort to keep the project's dependencies up-to-date, specifically targeting the `turbo` package. Although the PR description template prompts for detailed information regarding the motivation behind the changes, the current behavior of the software, the new behavior introduced by the PR, and whether the changes constitute a breaking change, these sections were left unfilled by the contributor. This leaves the specific objectives and motivations behind the update to the `turbo` package somewhat open to interpretation. However, the general intent seems to be maintenance-oriented, aiming to ensure the project stays current with the latest versions of its dependencies for potentially improved performance, security, or compatibility reasons.

The PR also includes a reference to closing an unspecified GitHub issue, indicated by the placeholder "Closes # <!-- Github issue # here -->", though the specific issue number was not provided. This suggests that the PR might be addressing a known issue or task that was tracked in the project's issue tracker, but without the exact issue number, the direct link between the PR and the issue(s) it aims to resolve remains unclear.

### AI-generated Summary of Generated Summaries

The primary change introduced in this Pull Request is the update of the `turbo` package from version `1.6.3` to `^1.13.0` in the project's `package.json` and `pnpm-lock.yaml` files. This update signifies a significant version bump, which could include new features, bug fixes, performance improvements, or other changes that come with moving from version 1.6.3 to 1.13.0 of the `turbo` package. The use of the caret (^) in the version number in `package.json` suggests that future updates that do not change the left-most non-zero digit will be automatically accepted, indicating a desire for the project to stay up-to-date with the `turbo` package within the constraints of semantic versioning.

Additionally, the PR includes a modification to the `turbo.json` configuration file, specifically removing the `baseBranch` declaration. This change could affect how the `turbo` tool operates within the project, potentially altering its behavior in terms of branch management or other aspects related to the removed configuration setting.

Overall, the PR focuses on updating a key dependency and adjusting the project's configuration to align with the updated version of the `turbo` package, without introducing new features or making breaking changes to the project's existing functionality.

### Chat

There are 3 ways to chat with CodeRabbit:

- Review comments: Directly reply to a review comment made by CodeRabbit. Example:
	- `I pushed a fix in commit <commit_id>.`
	- `Generate unit-tests for this file.`
	- `Open a follow-up GitHub issue for this discussion.`
- Files and specific lines of code (under the "Files changed" tab): Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new review comment at the desired location with your query. Examples:
	- `@coderabbitai generate unit tests for this file.`
	-	`@coderabbitai modularize this function.`
- PR comments: Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new PR comment to ask questions about the PR branch. For the best results, please provide a very specific query, as very limited context is provided in this mode. Examples:
	- `@coderabbitai generate interesting stats about this repository and render them as a table.`
	- `@coderabbitai show all the console.log statements in this repository.`
	- `@coderabbitai read src/utils.ts and generate unit tests.`
	- `@coderabbitai read the files in the src/scheduler package and generate a class diagram using mermaid and a README in the markdown format.`

Note: Be mindful of the bot's finite context window. It's strongly recommended to break down tasks such as reading entire modules into smaller chunks. For a focused discussion, use review comments to chat about specific files and their changes, instead of using the PR comments.

### CodeRabbit Commands (invoked as PR comments)

- `@coderabbitai pause` to pause the reviews on a PR.
- `@coderabbitai resume` to resume the paused reviews.
- `@coderabbitai review` to trigger a review. This is useful when automatic reviews are disabled for the repository.
- `@coderabbitai resolve` resolve all the CodeRabbit review comments.
- `@coderabbitai help` to get help.


Additionally, you can add `@coderabbitai ignore` anywhere in the PR description to prevent this PR from being reviewed.

### CodeRabbit Configration File (`.coderabbit.yaml`)

- You can programmatically configure CodeRabbit by adding a `.coderabbit.yaml` file to the root of your repository.
