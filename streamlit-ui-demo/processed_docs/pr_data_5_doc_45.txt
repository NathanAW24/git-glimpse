## Walkthrough

The changes made to the `useMenuItem` function in the `use-menu-item.ts` file modify the logic for setting the `data-selectable` attribute. The new implementation ensures that the attribute reflects both the `isPressed` and `isSelectable` states, enhancing the control flow of the menu item interaction.

packages/components/menu/src/use-menu-item.ts: ## AI-generated summary of changes

The diff introduces a modification to the logic within the `useMenuItem` function in the `use-menu-item.ts` file. Specifically, the change alters the condition under which the `data-selectable` attribute is set. Previously, `data-selectable` was assigned the value of `dataAttr(isSelectable)`, which directly reflected the `isSelectable` state. The new implementation changes this to `dataAttr(isPressed ? isSelectable : false)`, meaning that the `data-selectable` attribute will now only be true if `isPressed` is true and `isSelectable` is also true. This introduces a dependency on the `isPressed` state, effectively modifying the control flow and the conditions under which the menu item is considered selectable. The change enhances the interactivity of the menu item by ensuring that it can only be selectable when it is pressed, potentially improving user experience in scenarios where the pressed state is significant.

## Objectives from Linked Issues

The linked issue, titled "[BUG] - Dropdown selection examples are not working in mobile," outlines the problem experienced by users testing the NextUI dropdown component on mobile devices. Specifically, the issue was reported by a user testing on a Xiaomi POCO F4 smartphone using the Chrome browser. The user noted that when accessing the single selection example from the NextUI documentation, they were unable to select options other than the default preselected option. The expected behavior was for users to be able to select different options from the dropdown. The issue was reproducible on the specified device and browser, highlighting a significant usability concern for mobile users. The objective of the linked issue was to ensure that the dropdown selection functionality works correctly on mobile platforms, allowing users to interact with the component as intended.

### Chat

There are 3 ways to chat with [CodeRabbit](https://coderabbit.ai):

- Review comments: Directly reply to a review comment made by CodeRabbit. Example:
	- `I pushed a fix in commit <commit_id>.`
	- `Generate unit testing code for this file.`
	- `Open a follow-up GitHub issue for this discussion.`
- Files and specific lines of code (under the "Files changed" tab): Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new review comment at the desired location with your query. Examples:
	- `@coderabbitai generate unit testing code for this file.`
	-	`@coderabbitai modularize this function.`
- PR comments: Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new PR comment to ask questions about the PR branch. For the best results, please provide a very specific query, as very limited context is provided in this mode. Examples:
	- `@coderabbitai generate interesting stats about this repository and render them as a table.`
	- `@coderabbitai show all the console.log statements in this repository.`
	- `@coderabbitai read src/utils.ts and generate unit testing code.`
	- `@coderabbitai read the files in the src/scheduler package and generate a class diagram using mermaid and a README in the markdown format.`
	- `@coderabbitai help me debug CodeRabbit configuration file.`

Note: Be mindful of the bot's finite context window. It's strongly recommended to break down tasks such as reading entire modules into smaller chunks. For a focused discussion, use review comments to chat about specific files and their changes, instead of using the PR comments.
