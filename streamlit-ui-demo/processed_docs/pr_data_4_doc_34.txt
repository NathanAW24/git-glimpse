## Walkthrough
This pull request introduces a patch to the `@nextui-org/theme` package, specifically modifying the label positioning in input and select components. The changes involve replacing the `origin-top-start` class with `origin-top-left` and adding the `rtl:origin-top-right` class for better support of right-to-left layouts. Additionally, several types and constants related to input and select components are exported, but the core logic and configuration of these components remain unchanged.

## AI-generated summary of changes

This diff introduces a patch to the `@nextui-org/theme` package, specifically addressing the placement of labels in input and select components. The changes ensure that labels are correctly positioned, enhancing the user interface and usability of these components.

Modifications include adjustments to the `label` class within the `input` and `select` components. In both components, the `origin-top-start` class has been replaced with `origin-top-left`, and a new class `rtl:origin-top-right` has been added to support right-to-left layouts. These changes affect the positioning of the labels in relation to their respective components, particularly in RTL contexts. The overall configuration of both components, including their variants and default settings, remains unchanged, with no alterations to the logic or control flow.

## Alterations to the declarations of exported or public entities

- Type exported: `export type InputVariantProps = VariantProps<typeof input>;` in `packages/core/theme/src/components/input.ts`
- Type exported: `export type InputSlots = keyof ReturnType<typeof input>;` in `packages/core/theme/src/components/input.ts`
- Variable exported: `export {input};` in `packages/core/theme/src/components/input.ts`
- Type exported: `export type SelectVariantProps = VariantProps<typeof select>;` in `packages/core/theme/src/components/select.ts`
- Type exported: `export type SelectSlots = keyof ReturnType<typeof select>;` in `packages/core/theme/src/components/select.ts`
- Constant exported: `export {select};` in `packages/core/theme/src/components/select.ts`

### Chat

There are 3 ways to chat with [CodeRabbit](https://coderabbit.ai):

- Review comments: Directly reply to a review comment made by CodeRabbit. Example:
  - `I pushed a fix in commit <commit_id>, please review it.`
  - `Generate unit testing code for this file.`
  - `Open a follow-up GitHub issue for this discussion.`
- Files and specific lines of code (under the "Files changed" tab): Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new review comment at the desired location with your query. Examples:
  - `@coderabbitai generate unit testing code for this file.`
  -	`@coderabbitai modularize this function.`
- PR comments: Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new PR comment to ask questions about the PR branch. For the best results, please provide a very specific query, as very limited context is provided in this mode. Examples:
  - `@coderabbitai gather interesting stats about this repository and render them as a table. Additionally, render a pie chart showing the language distribution in the codebase.`
  - `@coderabbitai read src/utils.ts and generate unit testing code.`
  - `@coderabbitai read the files in the src/scheduler package and generate a class diagram using mermaid and a README in the markdown format.`
  - `@coderabbitai help me debug CodeRabbit configuration file.`

Note: Be mindful of the bot's finite context window. It's strongly recommended to break down tasks such as reading entire modules into smaller chunks. For a focused discussion, use review comments to chat about specific files and their changes, instead of using the PR comments.
