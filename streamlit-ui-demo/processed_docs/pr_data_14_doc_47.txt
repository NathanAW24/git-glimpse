### PR Objectives

The pull request titled "fix(docs): listbox with description" with the number 2513 aims to address an issue in the documentation of a component, specifically the Listbox with Description example. The main problem identified is that the JavaScript (JS) code intended to be visible as part of the example is not being displayed to the readers. This issue significantly impacts the usability and educational value of the documentation, as the code snippets provide essential insights into how the components are used and configured.

To rectify this issue, the pull request proposes a change in the documentation file for the Listbox component (`listbox.mdx`). The description of the pull request provides a link (although not directly accessible in this format) presumably pointing to the intended new behavior or the result of the fix, suggesting that the correct display of the JS code has been achieved or demonstrated.

The pull request does not introduce any breaking changes, as indicated by the contributor, which implies that the modifications are confined to the documentation and do not affect the functionality or API of the components themselves. This focus ensures that the fix is unlikely to introduce any regressions or compatibility issues for users of the library.

Additionally, the pull request adheres to the guidelines for contributions by focusing on a single type of change (in this case, a documentation fix) and keeping the changeset as small and focused as possible. This approach facilitates easier review and integration of the proposed changes.

In summary, the objective of PR #2513 is to fix a specific issue in the documentation of the Listbox component, ensuring that the JS code examples are visible to users. This fix is crucial for improving the educational value of the documentation and aiding developers in understanding and utilizing the Listbox component effectively.

### Chat

There are 3 ways to chat with CodeRabbit:

- Review comments: Directly reply to a review comment made by CodeRabbit. Example:
	- `I pushed a fix in commit <commit_id>.`
	- `Generate unit-tests for this file.`
	- `Open a follow-up GitHub issue for this discussion.`
- Files and specific lines of code (under the "Files changed" tab): Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new review comment at the desired location with your query. Examples:
	- `@coderabbitai generate unit tests for this file.`
	-	`@coderabbitai modularize this function.`
- PR comments: Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new PR comment to ask questions about the PR branch. For the best results, please provide a very specific query, as very limited context is provided in this mode. Examples:
	- `@coderabbitai generate interesting stats about this repository and render them as a table.`
	- `@coderabbitai show all the console.log statements in this repository.`
	- `@coderabbitai read src/utils.ts and generate unit tests.`
	- `@coderabbitai read the files in the src/scheduler package and generate a class diagram using mermaid and a README in the markdown format.`

Note: Be mindful of the bot's finite context window. It's strongly recommended to break down tasks such as reading entire modules into smaller chunks. For a focused discussion, use review comments to chat about specific files and their changes, instead of using the PR comments.

### CodeRabbit Commands (invoked as PR comments)

- `@coderabbitai pause` to pause the reviews on a PR.
- `@coderabbitai resume` to resume the paused reviews.
- `@coderabbitai review` to trigger a review. This is useful when automatic reviews are disabled for the repository.
- `@coderabbitai resolve` resolve all the CodeRabbit review comments.
- `@coderabbitai help` to get help.


Additionally, you can add `@coderabbitai ignore` anywhere in the PR description to prevent this PR from being reviewed.
