MinValue Validation failed(with hideTimeZone as true)

MaxValue Validation failed

MaxValue Validation failed(with hideTimeZone as true)


🚀 New behavior
Below shows the new behaviour:

MinValue Validation failed

MinValue Validation failed(with hideTimeZone as true)

MaxValue Validation failed

MaxValue Validation failed(with hideTimeZone as true)

.changeset/calm-kids-visit.md: ## AI-generated summary of changes

This update introduces a patch for the `@nextui-org/date-input` package, specifically addressing issues with error messages displayed by the date-picker component. The modification enhances the validation error handling by ensuring that the date formatting in error messages aligns with the specified locale. This change improves user experience by providing clearer and more contextually appropriate feedback when date input errors occur, thereby ensuring that the date format is consistent with user expectations based on their locale settings. Additionally, the validation logic for date inputs in the `useDateInput` function has been enhanced by incorporating checks for minimum and maximum value constraints. The function now verifies if the `minValue` and `maxValue` properties are defined and generates localized error messages when range underflow or overflow occurs. Enhancements to the testing suite for the `DateInput` component have been made, specifically focusing on locale-based error messaging for minimum and maximum date values. Two new test cases have been added to verify that the component correctly displays error messages when the provided date values exceed the specified minimum and maximum constraints, respectively. Each test case utilizes the `I18nProvider` to set the locale context, ensuring that the error messages are formatted according to the specified locale. Overall, these changes enhance the functionality of the `DateInput` component by ensuring it provides appropriate feedback to users based on locale-specific date formats.

## Alterations to the declarations of exported or public entities

- `export function useDateInput<T extends DateValue>(originalProps: UseDateInputProps)` in `src/use-date-input.ts` → No changes to the function signature.
- `import {parseDate} from "@internationalized/date";` in `packages/components/date-input/__tests__/date-input.test.tsx` → Added import for `parseDate` from `@internationalized/date`.
- `import {I18nProvider} from "@react-aria/i18n";` in `packages/components/date-input/__tests__/date-input.test.tsx` → Added import for `I18nProvider`.
- `import {useLocalizedStringFormatter} from "@react-aria/i18n";` in `packages/components/date-input/src/use-date-input.ts` → Added import for `useLocalizedStringFormatter`.
- `import {intlMessages} from "../intl/messages";` in `packages/components/date-input/src/use-date-input.ts` → Added import for `intlMessages`.

packages/components/date-input/intl/messages.ts: ## AI-generated summary of changes

The newly introduced file `messages.ts` serves as a localization resource for date input validation messages across multiple languages. It provides a structured object that contains validation messages for minimum and maximum date values, formatted to include a placeholder `{date}`. Each language is represented by its locale code (e.g., "en-US" for English, "fr-FR" for French), and for each locale, there are three key messages: `minValidationMessage`, `maxValidationMessage`, and `badInputMessage`. These messages inform users about the acceptable date range and indicate when an invalid date is selected, ensuring that the input meets specified criteria. The implementation allows for easy integration into a date input component, enhancing user experience by providing localized feedback based on the user's language preference.

The control flow is straightforward; when a date input is validated, the corresponding messages can be retrieved based on the user's locale, allowing for dynamic and context-sensitive user feedback. This structure supports internationalization efforts by making it easy to add or modify messages for additional languages in the future.

## Alterations to the declarations of exported or public entities

- Added: `export default { ... }` in `messages.ts`

packages/components/date-input/src/use-date-input.ts: ## AI-generated summary of changes

The diff introduces significant enhancements to the `useDateInput` function in the `use-date-input.ts` file. The primary change is the addition of localized string formatting capabilities through the `useLocalizedStringFormatter` function, which utilizes `intlMessages`. This allows for dynamic generation of validation messages based on the minimum and maximum date values provided in the props.

The logic for handling validation errors has been expanded. Specifically, when the `minValue` prop is defined and a range underflow occurs, the code now constructs a localized error message that includes the minimum date and its corresponding time zone. This message replaces the existing error at the calculated index in the `validationErrors` array. Similarly, for the `maxValue` prop, if a range overflow is detected, a localized message is generated and inserted into the validation errors, reflecting the maximum date and time zone. Additionally, if the `badInput` validation detail is triggered, a corresponding localized message is generated and replaces the last entry in the `validationErrors` array. These changes enhance the user experience by providing clearer, context-sensitive feedback regarding date input validation, making the component more robust and user-friendly.

## Alterations to the declarations of exported or public entities

- Added: `useLocalizedStringFormatter` import from `@react-aria/i18n` in `packages/components/date-input/src/use-date-input.ts`
- Added: `intlMessages` import from `../intl/messages` in `packages/components/date-input/src/use-date-input.ts`

## PR Summary

The pull request titled "fix(date-input): modifying validation error containing date" (PR #3694) addresses an issue with the date format in validation error messages for the date-picker component. Currently, the validation messages are based on the browser's date format rather than the locale specified in the `NextUIProvider`. This behavior stems from the `react-aria` library, which uses the browser for validation. The PR aims to correct this by ensuring that the validation messages reflect the locale set in the `NextUIProvider`.

The description includes examples of the current behavior, showcasing validation messages for minimum and maximum value errors, both with and without the `hideTimeZone` option. Screenshots illustrate the discrepancies in date formatting. The new behavior, as demonstrated in additional screenshots, shows the validation messages correctly formatted according to the specified locale. The author confirms that this change is not a breaking change.

## Objectives from Linked Issues

The linked issue, titled "[BUG] - DateRangePicker error message not using NextUIProvider Locale" (Issue #3693), outlines a bug where the error messages for the `DateRangePicker` component do not adhere to the locale set in the `NextUIProvider`. The issue can be reproduced by setting a locale, such as 'en-GB', in the `NextUIProvider` and then using the `DateRangePicker` component. The expected behavior is that the error messages should reflect the provided locale format. For instance, instead of displaying "Value must be 8/29/2024 or later," the message should read "Value must be 29/08/2024 or later" when the locale is set to 'en-GB'. The issue highlights the need for the component to respect the locale settings to enhance user experience and consistency.

## Comments Summary

In the comments section of the pull request, the author, macci001, requested a review from the user `coderabbitai`. The response from `coderabbitai` was an automated message generated by CodeRabbit, indicating that a review was triggered. The message also noted that CodeRabbit is an incremental review system and does not re-review already reviewed commits, suggesting that the review process is ongoing and that the system is designed to streamline feedback on changes.

Following this, macci001 mentioned to another user, wingkwong, that they had added tests to the PR and encouraged wingkwong to review it again. This indicates an ongoing collaborative effort to ensure the changes are thoroughly vetted and tested before being merged.

In a subsequent comment, wingkwong asked macci001 to explain the necessity of including `packages/components/date-input/intl/messages.ts`, questioning whether this should be handled by the `react-aria` library instead of hardcoding it. macci001 clarified that the browser is responsible for the content of the validation messages and that `react-aria` does not play a role in this aspect. To customize the error messages based on the provided locale, they need to handle it themselves, referencing a related GitHub issue for further context.

The comments reflect a focused and efficient review process, with contributors actively seeking feedback and validation from peers. The succinct nature of the comments emphasizes the importance of addressing the specific bug related to date formatting in validation messages. Overall, the comments highlight the collaborative nature of the development process, where contributors work together to ensure that changes meet the project's standards and requirements.

// cc @wingkwong \n- wingkwong: @macci001 can you explain a bit why we need to include `packages/components/date-input/intl/messages.ts`? supposedly this should be handled in RA side instead of us hardcoding it (?)\n- macci001: Browser is responsible for the content of the validation messages and RA has no role to play in it. So in-order to cutomize error message based on the locale provided, we need to handle it by our self.

// cc @wingkwong \n- wingkwong: Got it. Lemme take a look later\n- devongovett: Hi, we consulted our globalization team, and decided not to change anything in React Aria. These validation error messages come from the browser, so they will be in the user's browser language setting (e.g. `navigator.langauge`). Unfortunately we don't have any control over that, so it cannot respect the `IntlProvider` setting. We decided that it was not worth the bundle size cost of including our own localized strings for every possible form error message (there are a lot). In most cases for real users, the browser locale and app-level language setting will match so we don't think this will be a common enough issue to justify the cost. If it is a real problem in your specific application then you can provide your own custom validation messages.\n- ryo-manba: Thanks @devongovett , for the clarification and your team's work on this.
I’ll go ahead and close this PR now.\n
