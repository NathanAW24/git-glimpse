## Walkthrough
The changes introduce a significant update to the `@nextui-org/date-picker` package, specifically addressing an issue where the `className` property in the `calendarProps` was being overridden. The update ensures that custom styles are respected and rendered correctly. Additionally, the `getCalendarProps` function in `use-date-picker.ts` has been modified to merge class names from `calendarProps.classNames` and `classNames` using a new utility function, improving class name handling without altering the overall structure of the `useDatePicker` function.

## PR Summary

The pull request titled "fix(date-picker): resolve override of calendarProps className" was created by the user alexbeno and is identified by the number 3826. The main objective of this PR is to address an issue where the `classNames` property within the `calendarProps` of the date-picker component was being overridden. This behavior resulted in any custom styles intended for the date-picker's calendar being ignored.

Prior to this fix, developers faced challenges in applying their desired custom styles due to the overriding of the `classNames` property. The current behavior prevented the intended customization, leading to a lack of flexibility in styling the date-picker component.

With the proposed changes in this PR, the `classNames` property in `calendarProps` will now be respected, enabling developers to apply custom styles as they intended. This enhancement improves the usability of the date-picker component by allowing for greater customization without compromising the functionality.

The author has confirmed that this change is not a breaking change, ensuring that existing implementations will not be adversely affected. Additional information regarding the PR is not provided.

### Chat

There are 3 ways to chat with [CodeRabbit](https://coderabbit.ai):

- Review comments: Directly reply to a review comment made by CodeRabbit. Example:
  - `I pushed a fix in commit <commit_id>, please review it.`
  - `Generate unit testing code for this file.`
  - `Open a follow-up GitHub issue for this discussion.`
- Files and specific lines of code (under the "Files changed" tab): Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new review comment at the desired location with your query. Examples:
  - `@coderabbitai generate unit testing code for this file.`
  -	`@coderabbitai modularize this function.`
- PR comments: Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new PR comment to ask questions about the PR branch. For the best results, please provide a very specific query, as very limited context is provided in this mode. Examples:
  - `@coderabbitai gather interesting stats about this repository and render them as a table. Additionally, render a pie chart showing the language distribution in the codebase.`
  - `@coderabbitai read src/utils.ts and generate unit testing code.`
  - `@coderabbitai read the files in the src/scheduler package and generate a class diagram using mermaid and a README in the markdown format.`
  - `@coderabbitai help me debug CodeRabbit configuration file.`

Note: Be mindful of the bot's finite context window. It's strongly recommended to break down tasks such as reading entire modules into smaller chunks. For a focused discussion, use review comments to chat about specific files and their changes, instead of using the PR comments.
