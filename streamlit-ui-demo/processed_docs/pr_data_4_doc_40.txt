### Chat

There are 3 ways to chat with [CodeRabbit](https://coderabbit.ai):

- Review comments: Directly reply to a review comment made by CodeRabbit. Example:
  - `I pushed a fix in commit <commit_id>, please review it.`
  - `Generate unit testing code for this file.`
  - `Open a follow-up GitHub issue for this discussion.`
- Files and specific lines of code (under the "Files changed" tab): Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new review comment at the desired location with your query. Examples:
  - `@coderabbitai generate unit testing code for this file.`
  -	`@coderabbitai modularize this function.`
- PR comments: Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new PR comment to ask questions about the PR branch. For the best results, please provide a very specific query, as very limited context is provided in this mode. Examples:
  - `@coderabbitai gather interesting stats about this repository and render them as a table. Additionally, render a pie chart showing the language distribution in the codebase.`
  - `@coderabbitai read src/utils.ts and generate unit testing code.`
  - `@coderabbitai read the files in the src/scheduler package and generate a class diagram using mermaid and a README in the markdown format.`
  - `@coderabbitai help me debug CodeRabbit configuration file.`

Note: Be mindful of the bot's finite context window. It's strongly recommended to break down tasks such as reading entire modules into smaller chunks. For a focused discussion, use review comments to chat about specific files and their changes, instead of using the PR comments.
