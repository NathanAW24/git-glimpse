### PR Summary

**Title**: fix(popover): arrow combine with border of box  
**User**: arindam1997007  
**Number**: 3316  

**Description**:  
This pull request addresses and closes issue #3235. The main objective is to ensure that the Popover arrow combines seamlessly with the border of the box. Previously, the arrow had a negative zIndex, causing it to be placed behind the content box. The update modifies the arrow to share the same zIndex as the content box and clips the rest of the arrow using the `clip-path` property. This change also affects the Tooltip component, as it shares the same design with the Popover component. The update does not introduce any breaking changes.

**Output**:  
The provided images show the visual changes where the arrow now correctly aligns with the border of the box.

### Objectives from Linked Issues

**Issue #3235**: [BUG] - Popover's arrow should combine with the border line of the box

### AI-generated summary of generated summaries

The updates across the files in the `@nextui-org/theme` package focus on enhancing the positioning and styling of popover elements. Specifically, in `popover.ts`, adjustments were made to the spacing calculations and the addition of `clip-path` styles for better visual presentation of popovers depending on their placement (top, bottom, left, right).

In `index.ts` within the `utilities` directory, a new import statement for `clipPath` was added, and the `clipPath` utility was included in the `utilities` object. Additionally, a patch was introduced in `.changeset/flat-insects-heal.md` to fix an issue where the popover arrow is now combined with the border of the box.

<summary>Tips</summary>

### Chat

There are 3 ways to chat with [CodeRabbit](https://coderabbit.ai):

- Review comments: Directly reply to a review comment made by CodeRabbit. Example:
	- `I pushed a fix in commit <commit_id>.`
	- `Generate unit testing code for this file.`
	- `Open a follow-up GitHub issue for this discussion.`
- Files and specific lines of code (under the "Files changed" tab): Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new review comment at the desired location with your query. Examples:
	- `@coderabbitai generate unit testing code for this file.`
	-	`@coderabbitai modularize this function.`
- PR comments: Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new PR comment to ask questions about the PR branch. For the best results, please provide a very specific query, as very limited context is provided in this mode. Examples:
	- `@coderabbitai generate interesting stats about this repository and render them as a table.`
	- `@coderabbitai show all the console.log statements in this repository.`
	- `@coderabbitai read src/utils.ts and generate unit testing code.`
	- `@coderabbitai read the files in the src/scheduler package and generate a class diagram using mermaid and a README in the markdown format.`
	- `@coderabbitai help me debug CodeRabbit configuration file.`

Note: Be mindful of the bot's finite context window. It's strongly recommended to break down tasks such as reading entire modules into smaller chunks. For a focused discussion, use review comments to chat about specific files and their changes, instead of using the PR comments.

### CodeRabbit Commands (invoked as PR comments)

- `@coderabbitai pause` to pause the reviews on a PR.
- `@coderabbitai resume` to resume the paused reviews.
- `@coderabbitai review` to trigger an incremental review. This is useful when automatic reviews are disabled for the repository.
- `@coderabbitai full review` to do a full review from scratch and review all the files again.
- `@coderabbitai summary` to regenerate the summary of the PR.
- `@coderabbitai resolve` resolve all the CodeRabbit review comments.
- `@coderabbitai configuration` to show the current CodeRabbit configuration for the repository.
- `@coderabbitai help` to get help.


Additionally, you can add `@coderabbitai ignore` anywhere in the PR description to prevent this PR from being reviewed.

### CodeRabbit Configration File (`.coderabbit.yaml`)
