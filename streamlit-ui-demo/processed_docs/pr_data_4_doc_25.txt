The `section` element now includes additional padding classes (`px-4 md:px-0`), enhancing its responsiveness. The `div` containing the title has been modified to center the text, and the title itself has been changed from "Community" to "Join Our Community." 

The gap between elements in the main `div` has been adjusted from `gap-8` to `gap-10`. The `Spacer` component's vertical spacing has been reduced from `y={12}` to `y={10}`. The `FeaturesGrid` component's class names have been updated to include a new grid layout (`grid grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3 gap-8`), which alters how features are displayed across different screen sizes. Overall, these changes enhance the layout and presentation of the community section.

### Chat

There are 3 ways to chat with [CodeRabbit](https://coderabbit.ai):

- Review comments: Directly reply to a review comment made by CodeRabbit. Example:
  - `I pushed a fix in commit <commit_id>, please review it.`
  - `Generate unit testing code for this file.`
  - `Open a follow-up GitHub issue for this discussion.`
- Files and specific lines of code (under the "Files changed" tab): Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new review comment at the desired location with your query. Examples:
  - `@coderabbitai generate unit testing code for this file.`
  -	`@coderabbitai modularize this function.`
- PR comments: Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new PR comment to ask questions about the PR branch. For the best results, please provide a very specific query, as very limited context is provided in this mode. Examples:
  - `@coderabbitai gather interesting stats about this repository and render them as a table. Additionally, render a pie chart showing the language distribution in the codebase.`
  - `@coderabbitai read src/utils.ts and generate unit testing code.`
  - `@coderabbitai read the files in the src/scheduler package and generate a class diagram using mermaid and a README in the markdown format.`
  - `@coderabbitai help me debug CodeRabbit configuration file.`

Note: Be mindful of the bot's finite context window. It's strongly recommended to break down tasks such as reading entire modules into smaller chunks. For a focused discussion, use review comments to chat about specific files and their changes, instead of using the PR comments.

### CodeRabbit Commands (Invoked using PR comments)

- `@coderabbitai pause` to pause the reviews on a PR.
- `@coderabbitai resume` to resume the paused reviews.
- `@coderabbitai review` to trigger an incremental review. This is useful when automatic reviews are disabled for the repository.
- `@coderabbitai full review` to do a full review from scratch and review all the files again.
- `@coderabbitai summary` to regenerate the summary of the PR.
- `@coderabbitai resolve` resolve all the CodeRabbit review comments.
- `@coderabbitai configuration` to show the current CodeRabbit configuration for the repository.
- `@coderabbitai help` to get help.

### Other keywords and placeholders

- Add `@coderabbitai ignore` anywhere in the PR description to prevent this PR from being reviewed.
- Add `@coderabbitai summary` to generate the high-level summary at a specific location in the PR description.
- Add `@coderabbitai` anywhere in the PR title to generate the title automatically.
