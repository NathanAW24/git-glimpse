### PR Objectives

The pull request titled "chore: fix typo" with the number 2583 aims to correct a typo across a wide range of documentation files within a project. Although the description section of the PR does not provide detailed information about the nature of the typo or the specific files affected, it follows the standard template for submitting pull requests, indicating a structured approach to contributing changes. The PR does not specify a linked issue, suggesting that the typo correction was identified by the contributor without a corresponding issue being reported by other users or developers.

The description template includes sections for adding a brief description of the changes, describing the current behavior and the new behavior introduced by the PR, and determining whether the changes constitute a breaking change. However, these sections are left unfilled, focusing the PR solely on the typo correction without delving into the implications of the changes on the project's functionality or user experience.

The PR adheres to the guidelines for creating pull requests, emphasizing the importance of keeping changes small and limited to one type of modification (in this case, a typo correction). This approach facilitates easier review and integration of the changes into the project.

### AI-generated Summary of Generated Summaries

The pull request makes a comprehensive correction across numerous README.md files within the project, specifically addressing a spelling error in a section title. The typo corrected involves changing "Licence" to "License" to ensure consistency across the documentation. This modification spans a wide array of components and utilities within the project, including but not limited to accordion, autocomplete, avatar, badge, breadcrumbs, button, card, checkbox, and many more, covering both UI components and hooks like use-aria-accordion, use-aria-button, use-clipboard, use-infinite-scroll, among others. Additionally, the correction extends to various utilities and tools provided by the project, such as aria-utils, framer-transitions, react-utils, shared-icons, and test-utils, as well as the templates used for generating new components, hooks, and packages (plop templates).

This extensive correction ensures that the documentation across the project maintains a uniform approach to the spelling of "License," which is crucial for consistency and professionalism. The change, although seemingly minor, reflects an attention to detail and a commitment to maintaining high-quality documentation standards. By correcting this typo across such a broad range of files, the PR enhances the readability and reliability of the project's documentation, ensuring that all references to licensing information are uniformly presented. This effort underscores the importance of consistency in documentation, especially in open-source projects where clarity and precision support community understanding and engagement.

### Chat

There are 3 ways to chat with CodeRabbit:

- Review comments: Directly reply to a review comment made by CodeRabbit. Example:
	- `I pushed a fix in commit <commit_id>.`
	- `Generate unit-tests for this file.`
	- `Open a follow-up GitHub issue for this discussion.`
- Files and specific lines of code (under the "Files changed" tab): Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new review comment at the desired location with your query. Examples:
	- `@coderabbitai generate unit tests for this file.`
	-	`@coderabbitai modularize this function.`
- PR comments: Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new PR comment to ask questions about the PR branch. For the best results, please provide a very specific query, as very limited context is provided in this mode. Examples:
	- `@coderabbitai generate interesting stats about this repository and render them as a table.`
	- `@coderabbitai show all the console.log statements in this repository.`
	- `@coderabbitai read src/utils.ts and generate unit tests.`
	- `@coderabbitai read the files in the src/scheduler package and generate a class diagram using mermaid and a README in the markdown format.`

Note: Be mindful of the bot's finite context window. It's strongly recommended to break down tasks such as reading entire modules into smaller chunks. For a focused discussion, use review comments to chat about specific files and their changes, instead of using the PR comments.

### CodeRabbit Commands (invoked as PR comments)

- `@coderabbitai pause` to pause the reviews on a PR.
- `@coderabbitai resume` to resume the paused reviews.
- `@coderabbitai review` to trigger a review. This is useful when automatic reviews are disabled for the repository.
- `@coderabbitai resolve` resolve all the CodeRabbit review comments.
- `@coderabbitai help` to get help.


Additionally, you can add `@coderabbitai ignore` anywhere in the PR description to prevent this PR from being reviewed.

### CodeRabbit Configration File (`.coderabbit.yaml`)

- You can programmatically configure CodeRabbit by adding a `.coderabbit.yaml` file to the root of your repository.
- The JSON schema for the configuration file is available [here](https://coderabbit.ai/integrations/coderabbit-overrides.v2.json).
- If your editor has YAML language server enabled, you can add the path at the top of this file to enable auto-completion and validation: `# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://coderabbit.ai/integrations/coderabbit-overrides.v2.json`
