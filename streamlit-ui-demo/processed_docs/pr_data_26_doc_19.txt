Description:
Closes #742
üìù Description
https://nextui.org/docs/components/link#external-link miss isExternal prop.
‚õ≥Ô∏è Current behavior (updates)

üöÄ New behavior

üí£ Is this a breaking change (Yes/No):

No
üìù Additional Information
Link uses isExternal prop just to control whether to show LinkIcon. The literal meaning of isExternal is a bit obscure. Maybe naming it icon is better? When icon is set true, show default internal LinkIcon; When icon is set other icon component, then just show it. @jrgarciadev

A member of the Team first needs to [authorize it](https://vercel.com/git/authorize?team=NextUI&type=github&job=%7B%22headInfo%22%3A%7B%22sha%22%3A%2253ce84d8a204891d3e14f06700ef5e48fd3a4e5e%22%7D%2C%22id%22%3A%22QmVmEdZsv21AfGxuVHfwXu92th3HeHPCSGPcjS1QE7goax%22%2C%22org%22%3A%22nextui-org%22%2C%22prId%22%3A743%2C%22repo%22%3A%22nextui%22%7D).

\n- benmneb: whats the deal with the `icon` prop here? it just puts `Warning: Received 'true' for a non-boolean attribute 'icon'.` in the console\n- sun0day: > whats the deal with the `icon` prop here? it just puts `Warning: Received 'true' for a non-boolean attribute 'icon'.` in the console

For now, `icon` prop is useless, see https://nextui.org/docs/components/link#link-props, and `Link` will pass it directly into the `a` tag which causes the warning output. I'll remove it from the example.
\n- jrgarciadev: Hey @sun0day thanks for your contribution, however, the `isExternal` prop has already been included in the example, would you like to send another PR with the suggestions you made?

1. Add the `rel="noopener"` & `target="_blank` when the `isExternal` prop is `true`
2. Add a prop called `externalcon?: React.ReactNode` in case it's defined render it, otherwise render the `LinkIcon`


Thanks beforehand! üôèüèª \n
