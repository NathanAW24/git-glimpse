## Walkthrough

The recent changes introduce a utility function, `isReactFile`, to the `useSandpack` hook, enhancing its ability to identify React files accurately. This addition refines the logic for including React import statements, ensuring they are only added when necessary based on file content. The updates improve both functionality and maintainability by encapsulating file type checks and refining type annotations.

# Existing changesets

apps/docs/components/sandpack/use-sandpack.ts: ## AI-generated summary of changes

The changes in the `use-sandpack.ts` file introduce a new utility function, `isReactFile`, which checks whether a given filename ends with `.jsx` or `.tsx`. This function enhances the logic within the `useSandpack` hook by determining if the current file being processed is a React file. The logic for handling React imports has been modified to utilize this new function. Specifically, the condition that checks whether to add the React import statement has been updated to first verify if the file is a React file using `isReactFile`. This ensures that the import statement is only added for relevant files, improving the specificity of the logic. Additionally, minor adjustments were made to type annotations, particularly for the `match` variable, which is now explicitly typed as `RegExpExecArray | null`. Overall, these changes enhance the functionality and maintainability of the code by encapsulating the file type check and refining the import logic.



## Alterations to the declarations of exported or public entities

- `function isReactFile(key: string)` in `apps/docs/components/sandpack/use-sandpack.ts` ‚Üí `function isReactFile(key: string)` in `apps/docs/components/sandpack/use-sandpack.ts` (new function added)


# New changesets

apps/docs/components/sandpack/use-sandpack.ts: ## AI-generated summary of changes

The changes in the `use-sandpack.ts` file modify the logic for handling React import statements within the `useSandpack` hook. The condition to check whether to add a React import has been refined to ensure that it only applies to files that contain React components. Specifically, the check now verifies if the file content includes `React.` before determining whether to prepend the React import statement. This change enhances the specificity of the import logic, ensuring that unnecessary imports are avoided. Additionally, the type annotation for the `match` variable has been updated to `RegExpExecArray | null`, improving type safety. Overall, these modifications enhance the clarity and maintainability of the code by ensuring that React imports are only added where appropriate.

## Alterations to the declarations of exported or public entities

- `let match: RegExpExecArray | null` in `apps/docs/components/sandpack/use-sandpack.ts` ‚Üí `let match: RegExpExecArray | null` in `apps/docs/components/sandpack/use-sandpack.ts` (type annotation updated)

### Chat

There are 3 ways to chat with [CodeRabbit](https://coderabbit.ai):

- Review comments: Directly reply to a review comment made by CodeRabbit. Example:
	- `I pushed a fix in commit <commit_id>.`
	- `Generate unit testing code for this file.`
	- `Open a follow-up GitHub issue for this discussion.`
- Files and specific lines of code (under the "Files changed" tab): Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new review comment at the desired location with your query. Examples:
	- `@coderabbitai generate unit testing code for this file.`
	-	`@coderabbitai modularize this function.`
- PR comments: Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new PR comment to ask questions about the PR branch. For the best results, please provide a very specific query, as very limited context is provided in this mode. Examples:
	- `@coderabbitai generate interesting stats about this repository and render them as a table.`
	- `@coderabbitai show all the console.log statements in this repository.`
	- `@coderabbitai read src/utils.ts and generate unit testing code.`
	- `@coderabbitai read the files in the src/scheduler package and generate a class diagram using mermaid and a README in the markdown format.`
	- `@coderabbitai help me debug CodeRabbit configuration file.`

Note: Be mindful of the bot's finite context window. It's strongly recommended to break down tasks such as reading entire modules into smaller chunks. For a focused discussion, use review comments to chat about specific files and their changes, instead of using the PR comments.

### CodeRabbit Commands (invoked as PR comments)

- `@coderabbitai full review` to do a full review from scratch and review all the files again.
- `@coderabbitai summary` to regenerate the summary of the PR.
- `@coderabbitai resolve` resolve all the CodeRabbit review comments.
- `@coderabbitai configuration` to show the current CodeRabbit configuration for the repository.
- `@coderabbitai help` to get help.


Additionally, you can add `@coderabbitai ignore` anywhere in the PR description to prevent this PR from being reviewed.

### CodeRabbit Configuration File (`.coderabbit.yaml`)

- You can programmatically configure CodeRabbit by adding a `.coderabbit.yaml` file to the root of your repository.
- Please see the [configuration documentation](https://docs.coderabbit.ai/guides/configure-coderabbit) for more information.
