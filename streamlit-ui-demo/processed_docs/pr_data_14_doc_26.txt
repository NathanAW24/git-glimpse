## Walkthrough

The change involves updating the `website` field for a sponsor in the `apps/docs/.sponsorsrc` file. Specifically, the website link for the sponsor with the GitHub link `https://github.com/HighError` was changed from `"https://higherror.github.io/"` to `null`. This update appears to address an issue with broken user links in the "Support Us" section of a website, ensuring users are not led to 404 pages when clicking on sponsor links.

### PR Objectives

This pull request, numbered 2576, aims to address an issue identified in the NextUI website's "Sponsor us" section, where certain user links were leading to 404 pages instead of their intended destinations. The problem was highlighted in issue #2575, which detailed that clicking on some user links under the "Sponsor us" section resulted in 404 errors, indicating that the links were either broken or outdated. The issue specifically mentioned the link to the "HigherError user" as an example of one that led to a 404 page. The user's correct OpenCollective page was provided as the intended destination.

The pull request proposes a fix to this issue by updating the links to ensure they navigate to the correct pages, thereby improving the user experience on the NextUI website. The description of the pull request outlines the current behavior, where certain links lead to 404 pages, and the new behavior, which ensures that the links direct users to the correct OpenCollective pages. The change is not considered a breaking change, indicating that it does not affect the website's functionality beyond correcting the broken links.

Additionally, the pull request includes a change to the `apps/docs/.sponsorsrc` file, specifically updating the `website` field for a sponsor with the GitHub link `https://github.com/HighError`. The change involves setting the `website` field to `null` from its previous value of `"https://higherror.github.io/"`. This adjustment is part of the effort to correct the broken or outdated links in the "Sponsor us" section of the NextUI website.

### Chat

There are 3 ways to chat with CodeRabbit:

- Review comments: Directly reply to a review comment made by CodeRabbit. Example:
	- `I pushed a fix in commit <commit_id>.`
	- `Generate unit-tests for this file.`
	- `Open a follow-up GitHub issue for this discussion.`
- Files and specific lines of code (under the "Files changed" tab): Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new review comment at the desired location with your query. Examples:
	- `@coderabbitai generate unit tests for this file.`
	-	`@coderabbitai modularize this function.`
- PR comments: Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new PR comment to ask questions about the PR branch. For the best results, please provide a very specific query, as very limited context is provided in this mode. Examples:
	- `@coderabbitai generate interesting stats about this repository and render them as a table.`
	- `@coderabbitai show all the console.log statements in this repository.`
	- `@coderabbitai read src/utils.ts and generate unit tests.`
	- `@coderabbitai read the files in the src/scheduler package and generate a class diagram using mermaid and a README in the markdown format.`

Note: Be mindful of the bot's finite context window. It's strongly recommended to break down tasks such as reading entire modules into smaller chunks. For a focused discussion, use review comments to chat about specific files and their changes, instead of using the PR comments.

- `@coderabbitai resolve` resolve all the CodeRabbit review comments.
- `@coderabbitai help` to get help.


Additionally, you can add `@coderabbitai ignore` anywhere in the PR description to prevent this PR from being reviewed.
