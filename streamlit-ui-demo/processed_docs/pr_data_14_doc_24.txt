### PR Objectives

The primary objective of Pull Request (PR) number 2584 is to address an issue related to the missing export of the `TableRowProps` type in a library's table component package. The title "fix: missing export of TableRowProps type" succinctly captures the essence of the PR, indicating that it is a fix for a previously unexported type that is likely needed by consumers of the library for type safety and IntelliSense in their development environments.

The PR does not explicitly mention any linked issues, but the nature of the fix suggests that either developers using the library have encountered difficulties due to the absence of the `TableRowProps` type export, or the library maintainers identified this as a gap in their API surface during internal reviews or development. The absence of this export could hinder developers from fully leveraging TypeScript's capabilities for type checking and auto-completion, leading to a less optimal developer experience.

Given the context and the specific change mentioned in the generated summary of changes, it's clear that the PR's scope is quite focused. It aims to enhance the library's usability and developer experience by ensuring that all relevant types are properly exported. This kind of fix is crucial for maintaining the quality and developer-friendliness of a library, especially one that is likely used in complex applications where type safety is paramount.

### AI-generated Summary of Generated Summaries

The Pull Request (PR) number 2584 introduces a singular but significant change to the library's table component package. It rectifies an oversight by adding an export statement for the `TableRowProps` type from the `./table-row` file. This change ensures that developers utilizing the library can now access and use the `TableRowProps` type directly, which is essential for type safety, code completion, and leveraging the full capabilities of TypeScript in their projects. This fix enhances the developer experience by making the library's API more complete and robust.

### Chat

There are 3 ways to chat with [CodeRabbit](https://coderabbit.ai):

- Review comments: Directly reply to a review comment made by CodeRabbit. Example:
	- `I pushed a fix in commit <commit_id>.`
	- `Generate unit testing code for this file.`
	- `Open a follow-up GitHub issue for this discussion.`
- Files and specific lines of code (under the "Files changed" tab): Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new review comment at the desired location with your query. Examples:
	- `@coderabbitai generate unit testing code for this file.`
	-	`@coderabbitai modularize this function.`
- PR comments: Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new PR comment to ask questions about the PR branch. For the best results, please provide a very specific query, as very limited context is provided in this mode. Examples:
	- `@coderabbitai generate interesting stats about this repository and render them as a table.`
	- `@coderabbitai show all the console.log statements in this repository.`
	- `@coderabbitai read src/utils.ts and generate unit testing code.`
	- `@coderabbitai read the files in the src/scheduler package and generate a class diagram using mermaid and a README in the markdown format.`

Note: Be mindful of the bot's finite context window. It's strongly recommended to break down tasks such as reading entire modules into smaller chunks. For a focused discussion, use review comments to chat about specific files and their changes, instead of using the PR comments.

### CodeRabbit Commands (invoked as PR comments)

- `@coderabbitai pause` to pause the reviews on a PR.
- `@coderabbitai resume` to resume the paused reviews.
- `@coderabbitai review` to trigger a review. This is useful when automatic reviews are disabled for the repository.
- `@coderabbitai resolve` resolve all the CodeRabbit review comments.
- `@coderabbitai help` to get help.


Additionally, you can add `@coderabbitai ignore` anywhere in the PR description to prevent this PR from being reviewed.

### CodeRabbit Configration File (`.coderabbit.yaml`)

- You can programmatically configure CodeRabbit by adding a `.coderabbit.yaml` file to the root of your repository.
- Please see the [configuration documentation](https://docs.coderabbit.ai/guides/configure-coderabbit) for more information.
- If your editor has YAML language server enabled, you can add the path at the top of this file to enable auto-completion and validation: `# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://coderabbit.ai/integrations/schema.v2.json`
