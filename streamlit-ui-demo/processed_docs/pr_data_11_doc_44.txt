## Walkthrough
The update to the `Chip` component introduces an `aria-label` for the close button, enhancing accessibility by providing a descriptive label when the `isCloseable` property is true.

### PR Objectives

This pull request, numbered 2855 and titled "fix(components): added aria label to chip close button," addresses an accessibility issue identified in the Chip component of a UI library. The main objective of the PR is to enhance the accessibility of the Chip component by adding an `aria-label` attribute to the close button. This change is intended to resolve issue #2802, which highlights the absence of an `aria-label` on the close button, causing accessibility tests to fail for chips that are closable.

The PR description provides a clear before-and-after scenario. Initially, the close button on the Chip component lacked an `aria-label`, which is crucial for screen readers and other assistive technologies to provide context to users about the button's function. The absence of this label was visually confirmed through screenshots showing the button's code without the `aria-label`.

With the proposed changes, the `aria-label` attribute has been added with the value "close-button". This modification is visually represented in the updated screenshots included in the PR, showing the presence of the `aria-label` in the button's HTML. This enhancement is expected to improve the user experience for those relying on assistive technologies, making the component more inclusive and compliant with accessibility standards.

The PR is categorized as a bugfix, indicating that it corrects an unintended behavior (lack of accessibility features) rather than adding new functionality or refactoring existing code. It is confirmed that this change does not introduce any breaking changes to the existing functionality of the component library.

### AI-Generated Summary of Generated Summaries

The modification made in the `Chip` component involves the addition of an `aria-label` attribute with the value "close-button" to the `<span>` element that serves as the close button, but only when the `isCloseable` property of the Chip is set to true. This change directly targets improving accessibility by providing essential descriptive text that assists screen readers and other assistive technologies in interpreting the function of the close button.

`36-40`: The addition of the `aria-label` attribute to the close button when `isCloseable` is true enhances accessibility, aligning with the PR's objectives.


Ensure that the `aria-label` integrates seamlessly with other attributes provided by `getCloseButtonProps()`.

### Chat

There are 3 ways to chat with [CodeRabbit](https://coderabbit.ai):

- Review comments: Directly reply to a review comment made by CodeRabbit. Example:
	- `I pushed a fix in commit <commit_id>.`
	- `Generate unit testing code for this file.`
	- `Open a follow-up GitHub issue for this discussion.`
- Files and specific lines of code (under the "Files changed" tab): Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new review comment at the desired location with your query. Examples:
	- `@coderabbitai generate unit testing code for this file.`
	-	`@coderabbitai modularize this function.`
- PR comments: Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new PR comment to ask questions about the PR branch. For the best results, please provide a very specific query, as very limited context is provided in this mode. Examples:
	- `@coderabbitai generate interesting stats about this repository and render them as a table.`
	- `@coderabbitai show all the console.log statements in this repository.`
	- `@coderabbitai read src/utils.ts and generate unit testing code.`
	- `@coderabbitai read the files in the src/scheduler package and generate a class diagram using mermaid and a README in the markdown format.`

Note: Be mindful of the bot's finite context window. It's strongly recommended to break down tasks such as reading entire modules into smaller chunks. For a focused discussion, use review comments to chat about specific files and their changes, instead of using the PR comments.

### CodeRabbit Commands (invoked as PR comments)

- `@coderabbitai pause` to pause the reviews on a PR.
- `@coderabbitai resume` to resume the paused reviews.
- `@coderabbitai review` to trigger a review. This is useful when automatic reviews are disabled for the repository.
- `@coderabbitai resolve` resolve all the CodeRabbit review comments.
- `@coderabbitai help` to get help.


Additionally, you can add `@coderabbitai ignore` anywhere in the PR description to prevent this PR from being reviewed.

### CodeRabbit Configration File (`.coderabbit.yaml`)
