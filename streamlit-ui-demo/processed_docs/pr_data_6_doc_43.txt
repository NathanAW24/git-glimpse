Closes #3528
üìù Description
After clicking twice outside checkbox(or switch or radio), it needed to be double clicked for toggle thereafter only in Chrome.
added select-none  in their css to prevent user: select and it solved the issue :)
In the recordings below I have used double click in outside region when taking the pointer aside. First video needed double click to toggle while second one needs single click only.
I tried to use ripple extension but it did not work , so ripple effect is not visible, however u can figure out from time lapse.

Prior to this fix, users experienced a double-click requirement to activate these components, which hindered usability.

packages/core/theme/src/components/checkbox.ts: ## AI-generated summary of changes

The diff introduces a modification to the CSS class applied to the `base` slot of the `checkbox` component in `checkbox.ts`. Specifically, the class string has been altered to include the `select-none` utility, which prevents text selection within the checkbox component. This change enhances the user experience by ensuring that clicking on the checkbox does not inadvertently select surrounding text, thereby improving usability and interaction clarity. The overall structure and functionality of the checkbox remain intact, with the primary focus on enhancing the visual behavior during user interactions.

## Alterations to the declarations of exported or public entities

- No changes to the declarations of exported or public entities were made in `packages/core/theme/src/components/checkbox.ts`.

packages/core/theme/src/components/radio.ts: ## AI-generated summary of changes

The diff introduces a modification to the CSS class string associated with the `base` slot of the `radio` component in the `radio.ts` file. Specifically, the class `select-none` has been added to the existing class list. This change enhances the component's behavior by preventing text selection when users interact with the radio buttons, thereby improving the user experience by avoiding unintended text selection during interaction. The overall structure and functionality of the `radio` component remain intact, but the addition of `select-none` alters the control flow regarding user interactions with the component.

## Alterations to the declarations of exported or public entities

- No changes to the declarations of exported or public entities were made in `packages/core/theme/src/components/radio.ts`.

---

packages/core/theme/src/components/toggle.ts: ## AI-generated summary of changes

The diff introduces a modification to the CSS class definitions within the `toggle` component in the `toggle.ts` file. Specifically, the change involves the addition of the `select-none` class to the `base` slot's class list. This adjustment alters the behavior of the toggle component by preventing text selection when the user interacts with it. The overall structure of the component remains unchanged, but the user experience is enhanced by ensuring that any text within the toggle cannot be selected, which is particularly useful in preventing unintended text highlighting during interactions. This change reflects a semantic enhancement to the component's functionality, aiming to improve usability and interaction consistency.

## Alterations to the declarations of exported or public entities

- No alterations to the declarations of exported or public entities were made in `packages/core/theme/src/components/toggle.ts`.

## PR Summary

The pull request titled "fix(checkbox, switch, radio): double click need in chrome after double click outside" addresses an issue where users were required to double-click to toggle checkboxes, switches, or radio buttons in Chrome after previously double-clicking outside these elements. The problem was identified in issue #3528, where the click behavior changed after interacting with disabled checkbox items. To resolve this, the author added the CSS class `select-none`, which prevents user selection and effectively corrected the click behavior. The PR includes recordings demonstrating the difference in functionality before and after the fix, showing that the toggle now requires only a single click following the implementation. The author confirms that this change is not a breaking change for existing users of NextUI.

## Objectives from Linked Issues

The linked issue #3528 describes a bug where the click behavior of checkboxes changes after interacting with disabled checkbox items. Specifically, users experienced the need for double-clicking to check or uncheck normal checkboxes after previously clicking on a disabled checkbox. The issue was observed in NextUI version 2.4.6 and was reported by a user on a sample website. The expected behavior is that clicking on a checkbox should consistently toggle its state without requiring a double-click, regardless of previous interactions with disabled items. The issue highlights the importance of maintaining intuitive and consistent user interactions within the UI components, particularly in Chrome. The pull request aims to restore the expected click behavior and improve user experience by ensuring that checkboxes, switches, and radio buttons respond correctly to single clicks after any prior interactions.

### Chat

There are 3 ways to chat with [CodeRabbit](https://coderabbit.ai):

- Review comments: Directly reply to a review comment made by CodeRabbit. Example:
	- `I pushed a fix in commit <commit_id>.`
	- `Generate unit testing code for this file.`
	- `Open a follow-up GitHub issue for this discussion.`
- Files and specific lines of code (under the "Files changed" tab): Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new review comment at the desired location with your query. Examples:
	- `@coderabbitai generate unit testing code for this file.`
	-	`@coderabbitai modularize this function.`
- PR comments: Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new PR comment to ask questions about the PR branch. For the best results, please provide a very specific query, as very limited context is provided in this mode. Examples:
	- `@coderabbitai generate interesting stats about this repository and render them as a table.`
	- `@coderabbitai show all the console.log statements in this repository.`
	- `@coderabbitai read src/utils.ts and generate unit testing code.`
	- `@coderabbitai read the files in the src/scheduler package and generate a class diagram using mermaid and a README in the markdown format.`
	- `@coderabbitai help me debug CodeRabbit configuration file.`

Note: Be mindful of the bot's finite context window. It's strongly recommended to break down tasks such as reading entire modules into smaller chunks. For a focused discussion, use review comments to chat about specific files and their changes, instead of using the PR comments.
