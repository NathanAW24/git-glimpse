Description:
üìù Description

Initialize throttleTimeout in the cleanup function to ensure that handler() runs properly after the scroll listener is re-attached.

‚õ≥Ô∏è Current behavior (updates)
If the scroll listener is removed while throttleTimeout is still pending, handler() is prevented from running by clearTimeout(throttleTimeout.current).
However, even after the scroll listener is re-attached, throttleTimeout.current is not null because clearTimeout() does not change the value of its parameter. As a result, handler() does not run indefinitely.
This behavior does not appear to be intended.
üöÄ New behavior
By initializing throttleTimeout.current with clearTimeout(throttleTimeout.current), ensure that handler() runs properly after the scroll listener is re-attached.
üí£ Is this a breaking change (Yes/No):
No

## Walkthrough

The `useScrollPosition` hook has been updated to re-attach the scroll event behavior, ensuring that it listens correctly for scroll events. Additionally, a line was added to set `throttleTimeout.current` to `null` when clearing the timeout, which aids in proper cleanup.

The new file introduces a patch for the `@nextui-org/use-scroll-position` package, specifically re-attaching the scroll event behavior in the `useScrollPosition` hook. This enhancement ensures that the hook correctly listens for scroll events, allowing components that utilize this hook to respond dynamically to user scrolling actions. The re-attachment of the scroll event behavior likely improves the performance and reliability of scroll position tracking within applications that depend on this functionality, ensuring that the scroll position is accurately captured and updated as the user interacts with the page.

## PR summary

**Title**: Fix re-attached scroll event behavior in `useScrollPosition`

**Description**: This pull request addresses an issue with the `useScrollPosition` hook where the scroll event handler does not execute properly after the scroll listener is re-attached. The problem occurs when the scroll listener is removed while `throttleTimeout` is still pending, leading to `handler()` being prevented from running due to `clearTimeout(throttleTimeout.current)`. Since `clearTimeout()` does not modify the value of its parameter, `throttleTimeout.current` remains non-null even after re-attaching the scroll listener, resulting in `handler()` not executing indefinitely. The proposed solution involves initializing `throttleTimeout.current` in the cleanup function to ensure that `handler()` runs correctly after the scroll listener is re-attached. This change does not introduce any breaking changes.

### Chat

There are 3 ways to chat with [CodeRabbit](https://coderabbit.ai):

- Review comments: Directly reply to a review comment made by CodeRabbit. Example:
	- `I pushed a fix in commit <commit_id>.`
	- `Generate unit testing code for this file.`
	- `Open a follow-up GitHub issue for this discussion.`
- Files and specific lines of code (under the "Files changed" tab): Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new review comment at the desired location with your query. Examples:
	- `@coderabbitai generate unit testing code for this file.`
	-	`@coderabbitai modularize this function.`
- PR comments: Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new PR comment to ask questions about the PR branch. For the best results, please provide a very specific query, as very limited context is provided in this mode. Examples:
	- `@coderabbitai generate interesting stats about this repository and render them as a table.`
	- `@coderabbitai show all the console.log statements in this repository.`
	- `@coderabbitai read src/utils.ts and generate unit testing code.`
	- `@coderabbitai read the files in the src/scheduler package and generate a class diagram using mermaid and a README in the markdown format.`
	- `@coderabbitai help me debug CodeRabbit configuration file.`

Note: Be mindful of the bot's finite context window. It's strongly recommended to break down tasks such as reading entire modules into smaller chunks. For a focused discussion, use review comments to chat about specific files and their changes, instead of using the PR comments.

### CodeRabbit Commands (Invoked using PR comments)

- `@coderabbitai pause` to pause the reviews on a PR.
- `@coderabbitai resume` to resume the paused reviews.
- `@coderabbitai review` to trigger an incremental review. This is useful when automatic reviews are disabled for the repository.
- `@coderabbitai full review` to do a full review from scratch and review all the files again.
- `@coderabbitai summary` to regenerate the summary of the PR.
- `@coderabbitai resolve` resolve all the CodeRabbit review comments.
- `@coderabbitai configuration` to show the current CodeRabbit configuration for the repository.
- `@coderabbitai help` to get help.

### Other keywords and placeholders

- Add `@coderabbitai ignore` anywhere in the PR description to prevent this PR from being reviewed.
- Add `@coderabbitai summary` to generate the high-level summary at a specific location in the PR description.
