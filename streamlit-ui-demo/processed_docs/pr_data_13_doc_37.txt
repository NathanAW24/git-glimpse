## Walkthrough

The modification involves adjusting the logic within the `generateComponents` function, specifically in how the status of a component is determined. Previously, components under certain conditions were marked as 'newPost'. The update changes this status to 'new', streamlining the categorization of component statuses.

### PR Objectives

The pull request, numbered 2665, introduces a naming convention change within the codebase. The primary objective of this PR is to rename the identifier `newPost` to `new`. This change is succinctly described in the PR's title "feat: rename newPost to new" and further elaborated in the description. The motivation behind this renaming effort is not explicitly detailed in the provided description, suggesting that the change is likely a part of internal codebase improvements or standardization efforts.

The description includes a placeholder for linking to a related GitHub issue ("Closes # <!-- Github issue # here -->"), though no specific issue is mentioned, indicating that this change might not be directly addressing a reported issue or that the linkage to the relevant issue was omitted. The brief description provided simply states, "Rename newPost to new," which directly reflects the PR's title, emphasizing the straightforward nature of the change being proposed.

An image link is included in the description, presumably to illustrate either the change or its impact, but without further context or the ability to view the image, its relevance remains unclear.

The PR adheres to several guidelines as outlined in the introductory comment: it focuses on a single type of change (in this case, a feature), aims to keep the change as small as possible, and does not introduce new external dependencies. These guidelines suggest an emphasis on maintaining simplicity and minimizing the potential for introducing errors or complications.

The template sections for describing current behavior, new behavior, and whether the change is a breaking one are left unfilled, which might imply that the change is self-explanatory or does not significantly alter the functionality in a way that would necessitate detailed explanations. The absence of details regarding the impact and migration path for existing users under the "Is this a breaking change" section could indicate that the contributors do not anticipate significant disruptions or required actions on the part of the users due to this change.

### AI-Generated Summary of Generated Summaries

The pull request makes a specific change in the codebase by renaming the identifier `newPost` to `new` within the `generateComponents` function located in the `postbuild.js` file of the `packages/core/react/src/scripts` directory. This modification adjusts the logic used to determine the status of a component, where the status will now reflect 'new' instead of 'newPost' under certain conditions. This renaming effort is part of a broader objective to possibly streamline naming conventions or improve clarity within the codebase. The change is presented as straightforward and not linked to any specific issue, suggesting it is a proactive improvement rather than a response to a reported problem. The PR is structured to be minimalistic, focusing solely on this renaming task without introducing additional changes or dependencies.

### Chat

There are 3 ways to chat with [CodeRabbit](https://coderabbit.ai):

- Review comments: Directly reply to a review comment made by CodeRabbit. Example:
	- `I pushed a fix in commit <commit_id>.`
	- `Generate unit testing code for this file.`
	- `Open a follow-up GitHub issue for this discussion.`
- Files and specific lines of code (under the "Files changed" tab): Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new review comment at the desired location with your query. Examples:
	- `@coderabbitai generate unit testing code for this file.`
	-	`@coderabbitai modularize this function.`
- PR comments: Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new PR comment to ask questions about the PR branch. For the best results, please provide a very specific query, as very limited context is provided in this mode. Examples:
	- `@coderabbitai generate interesting stats about this repository and render them as a table.`
	- `@coderabbitai show all the console.log statements in this repository.`
	- `@coderabbitai read src/utils.ts and generate unit testing code.`
	- `@coderabbitai read the files in the src/scheduler package and generate a class diagram using mermaid and a README in the markdown format.`

Note: Be mindful of the bot's finite context window. It's strongly recommended to break down tasks such as reading entire modules into smaller chunks. For a focused discussion, use review comments to chat about specific files and their changes, instead of using the PR comments.

### CodeRabbit Commands (invoked as PR comments)

- `@coderabbitai pause` to pause the reviews on a PR.
- `@coderabbitai resume` to resume the paused reviews.
- `@coderabbitai review` to trigger a review. This is useful when automatic reviews are disabled for the repository.
- `@coderabbitai resolve` resolve all the CodeRabbit review comments.
- `@coderabbitai help` to get help.


Additionally, you can add `@coderabbitai ignore` anywhere in the PR description to prevent this PR from being reviewed.
