Description:
I think it would be really convenient to pass the current value of an input field to the onContentClick handler for the use case that the content is a button that should submit the input value. I know there are other ways to solve this but directly passing the value in the handler seems by far the most simple version to me.

\n- peteole: What do you think about it?\n- jrgarciadev: Hey @peteole I really appreciate your contribution, however, the input value is already being sent through the `onChange` function, on the other hand, the content element render will probably change once we migrate the input to `react-aria`, stay tuned üôåüèº\n- peteole: Ok, I get it. The idea was that the content would be used as a submit-button and then it would be useful to pass the text to be submitted to the callback. Maybe you can consider this in the migration.\n
