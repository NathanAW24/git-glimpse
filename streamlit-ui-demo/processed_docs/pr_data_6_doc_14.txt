## Walkthrough
The documentation for the `Tabs` component has been updated to remove the `disallowEmptySelection` property, which was previously indicated as part of the component's API but does not exist in the current implementation. This change clarifies the available properties and aligns the documentation with the actual component functionality.

apps/docs/content/docs/components/tabs.mdx: ## AI-generated summary of changes

The diff modifies the documentation for the `Tabs` component, specifically in the section detailing the properties that can be passed to it. The main change is the removal of the `disallowEmptySelection` property from the table of available props. This property, which was of type `boolean` and indicated whether empty selection was allowed, is no longer documented, suggesting it may have been removed from the component's functionality. The remaining properties retain their descriptions and types, indicating that the overall structure and functionality of the `Tabs` component still support the other documented features without any additional changes to their definitions.

## PR Summary

The pull request titled "chore(docs): remove disallowEmptySelection from tabs page" was submitted by the user wingkwong and is identified as PR number 3648. This PR addresses an inconsistency in the NextUI documentation regarding the `disallowEmptySelection` property for the Tabs component. The property was incorrectly documented as part of the Tabs API but does not actually exist in the codebase. This update aims to correct the documentation by removing references to `disallowEmptySelection` from the Tabs page. The PR also references another related pull request (PR #3609) for context. It closes issue #3608, which reported the bug regarding the nonexistent property in the Tabs component.

## Objectives from Linked Issues

The linked issue, titled "[BUG] - disallowEmptySelection does not exist in Tabs in code," outlines the problem that the `disallowEmptySelection` property is mentioned in the documentation for the Tabs component, despite it not being implemented in the actual code. The issue was raised against version 2.4.6 of NextUI. The objective is to clarify the documentation to ensure that users have accurate information regarding the available properties for the Tabs component. The issue emphasizes that the absence of this property in the code creates confusion for developers relying on the documentation for guidance. The expected outcome is to align the documentation with the actual implementation, thereby improving the overall user experience and reducing potential misunderstandings.

### Chat

There are 3 ways to chat with [CodeRabbit](https://coderabbit.ai):

- Review comments: Directly reply to a review comment made by CodeRabbit. Example:
	- `I pushed a fix in commit <commit_id>.`
	- `Generate unit testing code for this file.`
	- `Open a follow-up GitHub issue for this discussion.`
- Files and specific lines of code (under the "Files changed" tab): Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new review comment at the desired location with your query. Examples:
	- `@coderabbitai generate unit testing code for this file.`
	-	`@coderabbitai modularize this function.`
- PR comments: Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new PR comment to ask questions about the PR branch. For the best results, please provide a very specific query, as very limited context is provided in this mode. Examples:
	- `@coderabbitai generate interesting stats about this repository and render them as a table.`
	- `@coderabbitai show all the console.log statements in this repository.`
	- `@coderabbitai read src/utils.ts and generate unit testing code.`
	- `@coderabbitai read the files in the src/scheduler package and generate a class diagram using mermaid and a README in the markdown format.`
	- `@coderabbitai help me debug CodeRabbit configuration file.`

Note: Be mindful of the bot's finite context window. It's strongly recommended to break down tasks such as reading entire modules into smaller chunks. For a focused discussion, use review comments to chat about specific files and their changes, instead of using the PR comments.

### CodeRabbit Commands (invoked as PR comments)

- `@coderabbitai pause` to pause the reviews on a PR.
- `@coderabbitai resume` to resume the paused reviews.
- `@coderabbitai review` to trigger an incremental review. This is useful when automatic reviews are disabled for the repository.
- `@coderabbitai full review` to do a full review from scratch and review all the files again.
- `@coderabbitai summary` to regenerate the summary of the PR.
- `@coderabbitai resolve` resolve all the CodeRabbit review comments.
- `@coderabbitai configuration` to show the current CodeRabbit configuration for the repository.
- `@coderabbitai help` to get help.


Additionally, you can add `@coderabbitai ignore` anywhere in the PR description to prevent this PR from being reviewed.

### CodeRabbit Configuration File (`.coderabbit.yaml`)

- You can programmatically configure CodeRabbit by adding a `.coderabbit.yaml` file to the root of your repository.
- Please see the [configuration documentation](https://docs.coderabbit.ai/guides/configure-coderabbit) for more information.
- If your editor has YAML language server enabled, you can add the path at the top of this file to enable auto-completion and validation: `# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://coderabbit.ai/integrations/schema.v2.json`
