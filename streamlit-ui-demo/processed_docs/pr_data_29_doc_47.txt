add config.yml file to help direct users to the helpful pages
add feature_request.yml


I consolidated the improve-and-existing-component.md and propose-a-new-component.md into this file. I mentioned inside this file that you can suggest improvement to an existing component or propose a new one

Motivation

Feel free to make edit to my Github branch, github now has Codespaces enabled for nearly all repos on Github.com ðŸŽ‰  
So you don't even need to run my code on your local computer since Codespaces allows you to edit in the browser now

\n- cliffordfajardo: Hi @Dhananjay-JSR - thank your for the valuable PR feedback. I learned quite a bit of the new features thanks to your suggesstions.

Changes made:
- added Code of Conduct
- fixed typos
- added field for selecting browser from dropdown list


### Follow Up Question from your original pull request feedback
I'm a bit reluctant to make the hyper links shorter for the some of the links inside the description labels since Github renders those very small & its easy to miss those links

![CleanShot 2022-03-01 at 09 11 36@2x](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6743796/156216010-4867d4d8-37b5-4f1c-9078-064ab752c519.png)



I believe one benefit of having the long URL (in places that is easier to miss) is that its much harder for people to miss the useful links in this context. Typically a user might be feeling rushed or frustrated when submitting a bug report or pull request and they might glance over the details.

The long explicit urls helps reduce friction for maintainers and make resources/tips for contributors a bit more easily accessible (hard to miss)

@jrgarciadev - any thoughts?


Not that this matters too much (view it more as a data point), other repos like solidJS and react-query also have the longer explicit URLs
- [react-query bug_report.yml](https://github.com/tannerlinsley/react-query/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.yml) file

- [solidjs bug_report.yml](https://github.com/solidjs/solid/blob/main/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.yml) file



Note:
@jrgarciadev - please feel free to make changes on my branch "allow edits from maintainers" is enabled âœ…

1.are you saying remove the code of conduct from the `feature_request.yml` and `bug_report.yml`?
2.can you point to the specific line or file?\n
