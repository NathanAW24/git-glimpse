## Walkthrough
The update in the `modal.ts` file includes a modification to ensure that modals with the property `size="full"` remain fullscreen even when `scrollBehavior="inside"` is used. This change specifically addresses an issue where the modal would not maintain fullscreen status under these conditions.

## Changes

| File Path | Change Summary |
|-----------|----------------|
| `packages/core/theme/src/components/modal.ts` | Added `min-h-[100dvh]` to `full` base style |

## Assessment against linked issues

| Objective | Addressed | Explanation |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| Ensure fullscreen modality with `scrollBehavior="inside"` for modals (#2681) | ‚úÖ |  |
| Resolve modal sizing issue when using `size="full"` and `scrollBehavior="inside"` (#2681) | ‚úÖ |  |

This change directly addresses the reported bug by modifying the minimum height styling, ensuring that the modal remains fullscreen as expected when these specific properties are applied.

### PR Objectives (User Provided Facts)

This pull request (PR #2683) addresses a specific issue with the modal component in the NextUI library, where the modal does not maintain its fullscreen size when the `scrollBehavior` is set to "inside" and the `size` is set to "full". The issue is documented in linked issue #2681.

The main objective of this PR is to ensure that when the modal's size is set to "full", it truly occupies the full screen, regardless of the scroll behavior settings. This is achieved by setting the minimum height of the modal to `100dvh` (100% of the viewport height), ensuring that the modal extends fully vertically across the screen.

The PR modifies the base style for the `full` size modal by adding a `min-h-[100dvh]` property, which explicitly sets the minimum height to the full height of the viewport. This change is made in the `modal.ts` file within the `packages/core/theme/src/components` directory.

The PR is categorized as a bugfix and is not expected to introduce any breaking changes to existing implementations of the NextUI modal component. It is focused solely on adjusting the CSS properties to fix the fullscreen behavior of the modal when certain properties are combined.

### AI-Generated Summary of Generated Summaries

The modification in the `modal.ts` file involves the addition of a CSS property `min-h-[100dvh]` to the base style configuration for modals when their size is set to "full". This change ensures that the modal's minimum height is explicitly set to the full height of the viewport, addressing the issue where the modal would not stay fullscreen when `scrollBehavior` is set to "inside". This adjustment is a targeted fix to enhance the modal's display behavior without affecting other functionalities.

### Chat

There are 3 ways to chat with [CodeRabbit](https://coderabbit.ai):

- Review comments: Directly reply to a review comment made by CodeRabbit. Example:
	- `I pushed a fix in commit <commit_id>.`
	- `Generate unit testing code for this file.`
	- `Open a follow-up GitHub issue for this discussion.`
- Files and specific lines of code (under the "Files changed" tab): Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new review comment at the desired location with your query. Examples:
	- `@coderabbitai generate unit testing code for this file.`
	-	`@coderabbitai modularize this function.`
- PR comments: Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new PR comment to ask questions about the PR branch. For the best results, please provide a very specific query, as very limited context is provided in this mode. Examples:
	- `@coderabbitai generate interesting stats about this repository and render them as a table.`
	- `@coderabbitai show all the console.log statements in this repository.`
	- `@coderabbitai read src/utils.ts and generate unit testing code.`
	- `@coderabbitai read the files in the src/scheduler package and generate a class diagram using mermaid and a README in the markdown format.`

Note: Be mindful of the bot's finite context window. It's strongly recommended to break down tasks such as reading entire modules into smaller chunks. For a focused discussion, use review comments to chat about specific files and their changes, instead of using the PR comments.

### CodeRabbit Commands (invoked as PR comments)

- `@coderabbitai pause` to pause the reviews on a PR.
- `@coderabbitai resume` to resume the paused reviews.
- `@coderabbitai review` to trigger a review. This is useful when automatic reviews are disabled for the repository.
- `@coderabbitai resolve` resolve all the CodeRabbit review comments.
- `@coderabbitai help` to get help.


Additionally, you can add `@coderabbitai ignore` anywhere in the PR description to prevent this PR from being reviewed.
