## Walkthrough

The changes introduce detailed instructions for implementing dark mode in NextUI applications, covering setups for both Next.js and plain React applications. Key additions include the integration of the `next-themes` library, which facilitates theme switching, and the creation of a `ThemeSwitcher` component. The documentation also emphasizes the necessity of defining theme names in the `tailwind.config.js` file.

## AI-generated summary of changes

The document provides an overview of implementing dark mode in NextUI applications, detailing the process for both Next.js App and Pages directory setups, as well as for plain React applications using Vite or Create React App. The changes include the addition of instructions for integrating the `next-themes` library, which allows for theme switching in Next.js applications. The setup involves installing the library, wrapping the application with the `NextThemesProvider`, and creating a `ThemeSwitcher` component to toggle between light and dark modes. The instructions for using the `use-dark-mode` hook in plain React applications are also included, outlining the installation and implementation steps for theme switching. Additionally, notes emphasize the importance of ensuring theme names exist in the `tailwind.config.js` file.



## Alterations to the declarations of exported or public entities

- Method added: `Providers` in file `app/providers.tsx`
- Method signature updated: `ThemeSwitcher` in file `app/components/ThemeSwitcher.tsx` (Next.js App Directory Setup) and `components/ThemeSwitcher.tsx` (Next.js Pages Directory Setup) with the addition of `mounted` state management.
- Method added: `useDarkMode` in file `components/ThemeSwitcher.tsx` for plain React applications.

## PR Summary

The pull request titled "fix(docs): typos in dark mode page" was submitted by the user wingkwong and is identified by the number 3823. The primary purpose of this PR is to address a typo found in the documentation related to dark mode in the NextUI library. Specifically, it aims to correct the spelling of the word "exits" to "exists" in the documentation note regarding theme names in the `tailwind.config.js` file. The PR is linked to issue #3821, which highlights this typo. The description section of the PR template is currently incomplete, lacking specific details about the current and new behavior resulting from the changes made. Additionally, there is no indication of whether this change constitutes a breaking change for existing users of NextUI.

## Objectives from Linked Issues

The linked issue #3821, titled "typo in docs," outlines a specific bug related to a spelling mistake in the NextUI documentation. The issue was reported for version 2.4.8 of NextUI and points out that in the documentation for dark mode, there is a misspelling of the word "exists" as "exits." The relevant text states: "Note: You can use any theme name you want, but make sure it **exits** in your tailwind.config.js file." The objective of the issue is to correct this spelling error to ensure clarity and accuracy in the documentation. The steps to reproduce the issue involve navigating to the dark mode documentation page, scrolling to Step 3, and observing the note about the tailwind configuration. The expected outcome is that the text should be spelled correctly, enhancing the overall quality of the documentation.

### Chat

There are 3 ways to chat with [CodeRabbit](https://coderabbit.ai):

- Review comments: Directly reply to a review comment made by CodeRabbit. Example:
  - `I pushed a fix in commit <commit_id>, please review it.`
  - `Generate unit testing code for this file.`
  - `Open a follow-up GitHub issue for this discussion.`
- Files and specific lines of code (under the "Files changed" tab): Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new review comment at the desired location with your query. Examples:
  - `@coderabbitai generate unit testing code for this file.`
  -	`@coderabbitai modularize this function.`
- PR comments: Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new PR comment to ask questions about the PR branch. For the best results, please provide a very specific query, as very limited context is provided in this mode. Examples:
  - `@coderabbitai gather interesting stats about this repository and render them as a table. Additionally, render a pie chart showing the language distribution in the codebase.`
  - `@coderabbitai read src/utils.ts and generate unit testing code.`
  - `@coderabbitai read the files in the src/scheduler package and generate a class diagram using mermaid and a README in the markdown format.`
  - `@coderabbitai help me debug CodeRabbit configuration file.`

Note: Be mindful of the bot's finite context window. It's strongly recommended to break down tasks such as reading entire modules into smaller chunks. For a focused discussion, use review comments to chat about specific files and their changes, instead of using the PR comments.

- `@coderabbitai pause` to pause the reviews on a PR.
- `@coderabbitai resume` to resume the paused reviews.
- `@coderabbitai review` to trigger an incremental review. This is useful when automatic reviews are disabled for the repository.
- `@coderabbitai full review` to do a full review from scratch and review all the files again.
- `@coderabbitai summary` to regenerate the summary of the PR.
- `@coderabbitai resolve` resolve all the CodeRabbit review comments.
- `@coderabbitai configuration` to show the current CodeRabbit configuration for the repository.
- `@coderabbitai help` to get help.

### Other keywords and placeholders
