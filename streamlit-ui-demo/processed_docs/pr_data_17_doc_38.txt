.changeset/giant-sheep-attend.md: ## AI-generated summary of changes

This new file introduces a patch for the input component from the NextUI library, specifically enhancing its support for right-to-left (RTL) layouts. The changes aim to improve the usability and accessibility of the input component in applications that require RTL text direction, which is essential for languages such as Arabic and Hebrew. The patch likely includes adjustments to CSS styles, layout properties, and possibly JavaScript logic to ensure that the input component behaves correctly in RTL contexts. This enhancement is crucial for developers looking to create inclusive user interfaces that cater to a diverse audience. Additionally, the CSS class names used within the `input` component have been updated from "left" and "right" directional classes to the more modern "start" and "end" classes, improving semantic clarity and aligning with contemporary CSS practices. Specifically, instances of `"right-3"` have been replaced with `"end-3"`, `"rtl:right-auto"` with `"end-auto"`, and `"rtl:left-3"` with `"start-3"`. Similar updates were made to the `label` classes, where `"left-2"` was replaced with `"start-2"`.

## Alterations to the declarations of exported or public entities

### Chat

There are 3 ways to chat with [CodeRabbit](https://coderabbit.ai):

- Review comments: Directly reply to a review comment made by CodeRabbit. Example:
	- `I pushed a fix in commit <commit_id>.`
	- `Generate unit testing code for this file.`
	- `Open a follow-up GitHub issue for this discussion.`
- Files and specific lines of code (under the "Files changed" tab): Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new review comment at the desired location with your query. Examples:
	- `@coderabbitai generate unit testing code for this file.`
	-	`@coderabbitai modularize this function.`
- PR comments: Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new PR comment to ask questions about the PR branch. For the best results, please provide a very specific query, as very limited context is provided in this mode. Examples:
	- `@coderabbitai generate interesting stats about this repository and render them as a table.`
	- `@coderabbitai show all the console.log statements in this repository.`
	- `@coderabbitai read src/utils.ts and generate unit testing code.`
	- `@coderabbitai read the files in the src/scheduler package and generate a class diagram using mermaid and a README in the markdown format.`
	- `@coderabbitai help me debug CodeRabbit configuration file.`

Note: Be mindful of the bot's finite context window. It's strongly recommended to break down tasks such as reading entire modules into smaller chunks. For a focused discussion, use review comments to chat about specific files and their changes, instead of using the PR comments.

### CodeRabbit Commands (Invoked using PR comments)
