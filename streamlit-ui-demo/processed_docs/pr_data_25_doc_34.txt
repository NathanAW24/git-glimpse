This error disappeared after cleaning cache and reinstalling dependencies.  But still, I think using circle depents is bad practice. We should avoid circle depents in case of some weird exceptions.



\n- tianenpang: I agree with you, but I think this error may be caused by other issues 🤔 and for the circular dependency, it's possible to use the webpack plugin to detect it automatically.\n- sun0day: I am pretty sure this origin reason is circular depents due to the exception description and my debug process. But the circular depents exception not always occurs, it depends the node_modules' physical topology,  `yarn` can't guarantee node_modules' topology always be the same every time you install or add new dependencies, especially when you host has node_modules cache.

And maybe we can  use eslint rule [import/no-cycle](https://github.com/import-js/eslint-plugin-import/blob/main/docs/rules/no-cycle.md) to discover the circular depends problems in dev stage.\n- jrgarciadev: Hey @sun0day I'll close this PR until we can reproduce it in a better way \n
