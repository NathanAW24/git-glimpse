## Walkthrough
This update introduces a modification to the `@nextui-org/theme` package, specifically to the `skeleton` component. The change involves adding the `pointer-events-none` class to the skeleton component, ensuring that any hidden content under the skeleton, such as buttons, cannot trigger events like clicks during the skeleton's display.

### PR Summary

**Title:** fix(theme): add pointer-events-none to skeleton base  
**PR Number:** 2972  

**Description:**  
This pull request addresses an issue identified in issue #1714, where content hidden by a Skeleton component could still trigger events, such as pressing a button. The proposed change involves adding `pointer-events: none` to the base style of the Skeleton component. This modification ensures that while the Skeleton is visible, any interactions with the elements it covers, such as clicks, will not trigger any underlying functionality.

**Linked Issue:**  
**Issue Number:** 1714  
**Title:** [Feature Request] Skeleton should prevent its hidden content from being clicked to trigger the onPress event for the hidden content example Button  
**Description:**  
The issue describes a problem where interactions with a Skeleton component can still activate underlying elements, such as buttons. The suggested solution is to apply `pointer-events: none` to the Skeleton component during its active state to prevent any events from being triggered by the hidden content. This change aims to ensure that while the Skeleton is visible, it completely disables interaction with elements it covers.

**Impact and Migration:**  
The pull request description does not specify whether this change is a breaking change. However, it implies a change in functionality that could affect existing implementations where interactions with elements covered by the Skeleton were expected to remain active. Users of the NextUI library incorporating this change may need to adjust their expectations or implementations accordingly if they rely on the previous behavior.

### AI-generated Summary of Generated Summaries

A recent update has been made to the `@nextui-org/theme` package, specifically within the `skeleton.ts` file located in the `packages/core/theme/src/components` directory. This update involves the addition of a new style class named `pointer-events-none` to the `skeleton` component. This class modification is intended to alter the component's interaction behavior by preventing it from receiving pointer events.

### Alterations to the Declarations of Exported or Public Entities

**File: `packages/core/theme/src/components/skeleton.ts`**

- **Before Change:**
  - The `skeleton` component did not include the `pointer-events-none` class in its list of applied classes.

- **After Change:**
  - Added `"pointer-events-none"` to the list of classes for the `skeleton` component, thereby modifying its interaction with user input events.

### Chat

There are 3 ways to chat with [CodeRabbit](https://coderabbit.ai):

- Review comments: Directly reply to a review comment made by CodeRabbit. Example:
	- `I pushed a fix in commit <commit_id>.`
	- `Generate unit testing code for this file.`
	- `Open a follow-up GitHub issue for this discussion.`
- Files and specific lines of code (under the "Files changed" tab): Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new review comment at the desired location with your query. Examples:
	- `@coderabbitai generate unit testing code for this file.`
	-	`@coderabbitai modularize this function.`
- PR comments: Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new PR comment to ask questions about the PR branch. For the best results, please provide a very specific query, as very limited context is provided in this mode. Examples:
	- `@coderabbitai generate interesting stats about this repository and render them as a table.`
	- `@coderabbitai show all the console.log statements in this repository.`
	- `@coderabbitai read src/utils.ts and generate unit testing code.`
	- `@coderabbitai read the files in the src/scheduler package and generate a class diagram using mermaid and a README in the markdown format.`

Note: Be mindful of the bot's finite context window. It's strongly recommended to break down tasks such as reading entire modules into smaller chunks. For a focused discussion, use review comments to chat about specific files and their changes, instead of using the PR comments.

### CodeRabbit Commands (invoked as PR comments)

- `@coderabbitai pause` to pause the reviews on a PR.
- `@coderabbitai resume` to resume the paused reviews.
- `@coderabbitai review` to trigger a review. This is useful when automatic reviews are disabled for the repository.
- `@coderabbitai resolve` resolve all the CodeRabbit review comments.
- `@coderabbitai help` to get help.


Additionally, you can add `@coderabbitai ignore` anywhere in the PR description to prevent this PR from being reviewed.

### CodeRabbit Configration File (`.coderabbit.yaml`)

- You can programmatically configure CodeRabbit by adding a `.coderabbit.yaml` file to the root of your repository.
- Please see the [configuration documentation](https://docs.coderabbit.ai/guides/configure-coderabbit) for more information.
- If your editor has YAML language server enabled, you can add the path at the top of this file to enable auto-completion and validation: `# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://coderabbit.ai/integrations/schema.v2.json`

<!-- tips_end -->\n- emre88tosun: @wingkwong thanks a lot for your work but with the latest release, even if the isLoaded is false, pointer-events-none stays as is. And I couldn't find anything in the documentation that says pointer-events-* should be handled further. So, am not sure if this is a bug or not. Could you please advise?\n- 0xd8d: This PR broke my website. Every element under a Skeleton is now never clickable, not even when loaded. Thanks.\n- wingkwong: @emre88tosun @DaniumX can you share your example code for me?\n- emre88tosun: @wingkwong already raised an issue: https://github.com/nextui-org/nextui/issues/3125
here's the stackblitz url: https://stackblitz.com/edit/stackblitz-starters-afsgee?file=app%2Fpage.tsx\n- wingkwong: oh sorry i miss that. thanks and let's track there. i'll take a look.\n- 0xd8d: @jrgarciadev It takes 1 second of looking at the changed line in this PR to spot the trouble it would bring. It is not some unknown secret that pointer-events-none affects all children. How could you possibly miss this and then go ahead and merge it in?\n- emre88tosun: @DaniumX there're lots of ways to fix this in ASAP solutions. you could downgrade to 2.3.6 or just paste data-[loaded=true]:pointer-events-auto to the all skeletons' class that you have. our production was affected too but I'm not crying here, fixed it already and waiting for a patch from these hardworking guys. please.\n- 0xd8d: > @DaniumX there're lots of ways to fix this in ASAP solutions. you could downgrade to 2.3.6 or just paste data-[loaded=true]:pointer-events-auto to the all skeletons' class that you have. our production was affected too but I'm not crying here, fixed it already and waiting for a patch from these hardworking guys. please.

That is if you are able to find what is causing the bug. My colleague wasted 2 hours trying to figure out what went wrong during our latest build. This is definitely a breaking change as it renders whole websites completely unusable.\n
