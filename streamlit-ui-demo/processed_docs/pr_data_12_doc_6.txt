## Walkthrough

This update introduces the `Viewport` entity to the import section and restructures the `viewport` object. The modifications enhance the application's layout by incorporating theme colors and scaling options directly into the viewport settings, ensuring a more cohesive and adaptable user interface.

## Changes

| File Path | Change Summary |
|-----------|----------------|
| `apps/docs/app/layout.tsx` | Added `Viewport` entity to imports and reorganized `viewport` object to include theme colors and scaling options. |

apps/docs/app/layout.tsx: ## Short summary

The change in functionality involves the addition of a `Viewport` entity to the import statement and the reorganization of the `viewport` object within the `metadata` and `viewport` declarations. The `viewport` object now includes specific properties related to theme colors and scaling options.

### PR Objectives

This pull request, titled "[bugfix] Update layout.tsx" and numbered 2826, addresses an issue where an unsupported metadata warning was displayed in the CLI during the use of a Next.js application. The warning indicated that the `themeColor` metadata was incorrectly placed in the metadata export section and should instead be moved to the viewport export section. The provided link in the warning directed users to the Next.js documentation for further guidance on configuring the viewport.

The primary objective of this PR is to eliminate this warning by correctly organizing the metadata and viewport properties in the `layout.tsx` file of the `apps/docs/app` directory. The changes involve the addition of a `Viewport` entity to the import statements and the reconfiguration of the `viewport` object to include specific properties such as theme colors and scaling options. This reorganization ensures that the properties are correctly placed according to Next.js guidelines, thereby removing the CLI warning and streamlining the configuration process.

The PR confirms that these changes do not introduce any breaking changes to the existing functionality of the application.

### AI-Generated Summary of Generated Summaries

The modifications in `layout.tsx` primarily involve the restructuring of metadata and viewport configurations to adhere to Next.js standards. A `Viewport` entity has been added to the import section, and the `viewport` object has been reorganized. This reorganization includes the correct placement of theme color settings and scaling options within the `viewport` declaration, ensuring compliance with Next.js documentation and eliminating related CLI warnings.

<!--Monologue:
[task review_file_1/1 segment_2/2] Analyzing the content of 'entries.ts' to determine its relevance to the new viewport settings.
[observations] The file 'entries.ts' contains a function `getHtmlFile` that generates an HTML file with a viewport meta tag. This tag uses a standard viewport setting: "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0". This does not directly relate to the new viewport settings defined in 'layout.tsx', which include more detailed configurations like theme colors and user scalability settings.
[analysis] The presence of a standard viewport setting in 'entries.ts' suggests that this file is not directly utilizing the new viewport settings from 'layout.tsx'. The integration of the new settings seems to be confined to 'layout.tsx' and does not appear to be widespread across other components or configurations.
[actions] Conclude the verification process by confirming that the new viewport settings are primarily integrated in 'layout.tsx' and not widely used across other parts of the application.
-->

The verification process has confirmed that the new viewport settings are primarily integrated within the `layout.tsx` file. Other files, such as `entries.ts`, contain standard viewport settings and do not utilize the new configurations. This suggests that the integration of the new viewport settings is limited and focused, which aligns with the initial review approval.

- `layout.tsx` correctly implements the new viewport settings.
- `entries.ts` and other files use standard or unrelated viewport settings.

### Chat

There are 3 ways to chat with [CodeRabbit](https://coderabbit.ai):

- Review comments: Directly reply to a review comment made by CodeRabbit. Example:
	- `I pushed a fix in commit <commit_id>.`
	- `Generate unit testing code for this file.`
	- `Open a follow-up GitHub issue for this discussion.`
- Files and specific lines of code (under the "Files changed" tab): Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new review comment at the desired location with your query. Examples:
	- `@coderabbitai generate unit testing code for this file.`
	-	`@coderabbitai modularize this function.`
- PR comments: Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new PR comment to ask questions about the PR branch. For the best results, please provide a very specific query, as very limited context is provided in this mode. Examples:
	- `@coderabbitai generate interesting stats about this repository and render them as a table.`
	- `@coderabbitai show all the console.log statements in this repository.`
	- `@coderabbitai read src/utils.ts and generate unit testing code.`
	- `@coderabbitai read the files in the src/scheduler package and generate a class diagram using mermaid and a README in the markdown format.`

Note: Be mindful of the bot's finite context window. It's strongly recommended to break down tasks such as reading entire modules into smaller chunks. For a focused discussion, use review comments to chat about specific files and their changes, instead of using the PR comments.

### CodeRabbit Commands (invoked as PR comments)

- `@coderabbitai pause` to pause the reviews on a PR.
- `@coderabbitai resume` to resume the paused reviews.
- `@coderabbitai review` to trigger a review. This is useful when automatic reviews are disabled for the repository.
- `@coderabbitai resolve` resolve all the CodeRabbit review comments.
- `@coderabbitai help` to get help.


Additionally, you can add `@coderabbitai ignore` anywhere in the PR description to prevent this PR from being reviewed.

### CodeRabbit Configration File (`.coderabbit.yaml`)

- You can programmatically configure CodeRabbit by adding a `.coderabbit.yaml` file to the root of your repository.
- Please see the [configuration documentation](https://docs.coderabbit.ai/guides/configure-coderabbit) for more information.
- If your editor has YAML language server enabled, you can add the path at the top of this file to enable auto-completion and validation: `# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://coderabbit.ai/integrations/schema.v2.json`
