## Walkthrough

The changes primarily focus on improving clarity and consistency in the NextUI documentation, particularly around installation instructions and setup for different environments and package managers. Key updates include refining instructions for pnpm usage, updating dependencies (e.g., Framer Motion from version 4 to 11), and adjusting Tailwind CSS setup steps. The goal is to provide a more streamlined, error-free setup experience, especially for pnpm and monorepo users, thus addressing several common pain points in the guide.

### PR Summary

**Title:** refactor(docs): overall documentation  
**User:** wingkwong  
**Number:** 3274  

**Description:**  
This pull request aims to refactor the overall documentation of the project. It addresses the issues outlined in issue #2599 by improving the installation instructions in the guide, especially for users who encountered problems using a React application created with Vite. The changes include clarifying the setup steps for pnpm, providing detailed instructions for deployment on platforms like Vercel, and addressing issues related to the `next-themes` package and Tailwind CSS configuration.

**Closes:** #2599

### Objectives from Linked Issues

**Issue #2599: [Feature Request] Improving installation instructions in the guide**

**Description:**  
The issue highlights several problems users face with the current installation instructions for the UI library, particularly when using React applications created with Vite. The main objectives are:

1. **Clarify Setup for pnpm:** The current guide's section on setting up pnpm is not clear, causing users to overlook it and face issues. The request is to emphasize the importance of this step earlier in the guide.

2. **Deployment on Vercel:** Users encountered missing styles when deploying on Vercel. The solution involves setting up `.npmrc` on Vercel, with a reference to Vercel's official instructions for using private dependencies.

3. **`next-themes` Package Issue:** After installing the `next-themes` package, users experienced a significant reduction in CSS file content. The issue was resolved by modifying the `tailwind.config.js` file, ensuring the styles remained intact.

The proposed solution includes detailed steps and code snippets to address each of these issues, enhancing the overall clarity and usability of the installation guide.

<summary>Tips</summary>

### Chat

There are 3 ways to chat with [CodeRabbit](https://coderabbit.ai):

- Review comments: Directly reply to a review comment made by CodeRabbit. Example:
	- `I pushed a fix in commit <commit_id>.`
	- `Generate unit testing code for this file.`
	- `Open a follow-up GitHub issue for this discussion.`
- Files and specific lines of code (under the "Files changed" tab): Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new review comment at the desired location with your query. Examples:
	- `@coderabbitai generate unit testing code for this file.`
	-	`@coderabbitai modularize this function.`
- PR comments: Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new PR comment to ask questions about the PR branch. For the best results, please provide a very specific query, as very limited context is provided in this mode. Examples:
	- `@coderabbitai generate interesting stats about this repository and render them as a table.`
	- `@coderabbitai show all the console.log statements in this repository.`
	- `@coderabbitai read src/utils.ts and generate unit testing code.`
	- `@coderabbitai read the files in the src/scheduler package and generate a class diagram using mermaid and a README in the markdown format.`
	- `@coderabbitai help me debug CodeRabbit configuration file.`

Note: Be mindful of the bot's finite context window. It's strongly recommended to break down tasks such as reading entire modules into smaller chunks. For a focused discussion, use review comments to chat about specific files and their changes, instead of using the PR comments.

### CodeRabbit Commands (invoked as PR comments)

- `@coderabbitai pause` to pause the reviews on a PR.
- `@coderabbitai resume` to resume the paused reviews.
- `@coderabbitai review` to trigger an incremental review. This is useful when automatic reviews are disabled for the repository.
- `@coderabbitai full review` to do a full review from scratch and review all the files again.
- `@coderabbitai summary` to regenerate the summary of the PR.
- `@coderabbitai resolve` resolve all the CodeRabbit review comments.
- `@coderabbitai configuration` to show the current CodeRabbit configuration for the repository.
- `@coderabbitai help` to get help.


Additionally, you can add `@coderabbitai ignore` anywhere in the PR description to prevent this PR from being reviewed.

### CodeRabbit Configration File (`.coderabbit.yaml`)

- You can programmatically configure CodeRabbit by adding a `.coderabbit.yaml` file to the root of your repository.
- Please see the [configuration documentation](https://docs.coderabbit.ai/guides/configure-coderabbit) for more information.
- If your editor has YAML language server enabled, you can add the path at the top of this file to enable auto-completion and validation: `# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://coderabbit.ai/integrations/schema.v2.json`

### Documentation and Community

- Visit our [Documentation](https://coderabbit.ai/docs) for detailed information on how to use CodeRabbit.
- Join our [Discord Community](https://discord.com/invite/GsXnASn26c) to get help, request features, and share feedback.
