## PR Summary

The pull request titled "fix(docs): broken links" was created by the user wingkwong and is identified by the number 3796. The primary aim of this PR is to resolve broken links in the documentation for the NextUI library. It specifically addresses an issue related to the date-picker component, as indicated by the closure of issue #3795. The description in the PR suggests that the changes made are focused on fixing these broken links, although it does not provide detailed information about the current and new behavior resulting from the modifications. Additionally, the PR does not specify whether it introduces any breaking changes for existing users of NextUI.

## Objectives from Linked Issues

The linked issue #3795, titled "[BUG] [DOCS] - Dead Link in Datepicker Docs," identifies a specific problem with the documentation for the NextUI library, particularly concerning the date-picker, time input, date range picker, and date input components. The issue highlights that a link on the documentation page, specifically the one leading to "ValidationResult," does not function correctly when clicked. The expected behavior is for this link to redirect users to the relevant GitHub file, but it currently fails to do so. The issue was reported for NextUI version 2.4.8, and the steps to reproduce the problem involve navigating to the documentation page and clicking on the faulty link. The reporter did not provide any screenshots or additional context regarding the operating system or browser, indicating that the issue is not dependent on those factors.

### Chat

There are 3 ways to chat with [CodeRabbit](https://coderabbit.ai):

- Review comments: Directly reply to a review comment made by CodeRabbit. Example:
-- `I pushed a fix in commit <commit_id>, please review it.`
-- `Generate unit testing code for this file.`
	- `Open a follow-up GitHub issue for this discussion.`
- Files and specific lines of code (under the "Files changed" tab): Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new review comment at the desired location with your query. Examples:
-- `@coderabbitai generate unit testing code for this file.`
--	`@coderabbitai modularize this function.`
- PR comments: Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new PR comment to ask questions about the PR branch. For the best results, please provide a very specific query, as very limited context is provided in this mode. Examples:
-- `@coderabbitai gather interesting stats about this repository and render them as a table. Additionally, render a pie chart showing the language distribution in the codebase.`
-- `@coderabbitai read src/utils.ts and generate unit testing code.`
-- `@coderabbitai read the files in the src/scheduler package and generate a class diagram using mermaid and a README in the markdown format.`
-- `@coderabbitai help me debug CodeRabbit configuration file.`

Note: Be mindful of the bot's finite context window. It's strongly recommended to break down tasks such as reading entire modules into smaller chunks. For a focused discussion, use review comments to chat about specific files and their changes, instead of using the PR comments.

### CodeRabbit Commands (Invoked using PR comments)

- `@coderabbitai pause` to pause the reviews on a PR.
- `@coderabbitai resume` to resume the paused reviews.
- `@coderabbitai review` to trigger an incremental review. This is useful when automatic reviews are disabled for the repository.
- `@coderabbitai full review` to do a full review from scratch and review all the files again.
- `@coderabbitai summary` to regenerate the summary of the PR.
- `@coderabbitai resolve` resolve all the CodeRabbit review comments.
- `@coderabbitai configuration` to show the current CodeRabbit configuration for the repository.
- `@coderabbitai help` to get help.

### Other keywords and placeholders

- Add `@coderabbitai ignore` anywhere in the PR description to prevent this PR from being reviewed.
- Add `@coderabbitai summary` to generate the high-level summary at a specific location in the PR description.
- Add `@coderabbitai` anywhere in the PR title to generate the title automatically.
