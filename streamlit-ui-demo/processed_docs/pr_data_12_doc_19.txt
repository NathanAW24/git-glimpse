## PR Summary

The pull request titled "fix(config): Cannot use .nvmrc" addresses an issue related to the `.nvmrc` file in the NextUI project. The change involves updating the version declaration in the `.nvmrc` file from `.x` to `.*`. This modification resolves a problem where executing the `nvm install` command would fail, preventing users from switching to the recommended version of Node.js. With the new behavior implemented in this pull request, the Node Version Manager (nvm) can correctly identify and install the appropriate Node.js version specified in the `.nvmrc` file. The author confirms that this change does not introduce any breaking changes to the project.

## Objectives from Linked Issues

The linked issue, titled "[BUG] - Cannot use .nvmrc," outlines a problem encountered when using the `nvm` command to switch Node.js versions. Users reported that executing `nvm use` before installing project dependencies resulted in an error, as nvm was unable to recognize the version specified in the `.nvmrc` file. The expected behavior was for nvm to find the version declaration, download the corresponding Node.js version, and confirm its usage. However, users received an error message indicating that the version '16.x' was not found. The objective of the linked issue is to ensure that the `.nvmrc` file correctly specifies a version format that nvm can interpret, allowing for a seamless installation process. The pull request aims to resolve this issue by changing the version format in the `.nvmrc` file, thereby enabling users to successfully execute the `nvm install` command without encountering errors.

### Chat

There are 3 ways to chat with [CodeRabbit](https://coderabbit.ai):

- Review comments: Directly reply to a review comment made by CodeRabbit. Example:
	- `I pushed a fix in commit <commit_id>.`
	- `Generate unit testing code for this file.`
	- `Open a follow-up GitHub issue for this discussion.`
- Files and specific lines of code (under the "Files changed" tab): Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new review comment at the desired location with your query. Examples:
	- `@coderabbitai generate unit testing code for this file.`
	-	`@coderabbitai modularize this function.`
- PR comments: Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new PR comment to ask questions about the PR branch. For the best results, please provide a very specific query, as very limited context is provided in this mode. Examples:
	- `@coderabbitai generate interesting stats about this repository and render them as a table.`
	- `@coderabbitai show all the console.log statements in this repository.`
	- `@coderabbitai read src/utils.ts and generate unit testing code.`
	- `@coderabbitai read the files in the src/scheduler package and generate a class diagram using mermaid and a README in the markdown format.`
	- `@coderabbitai help me debug CodeRabbit configuration file.`

Note: Be mindful of the bot's finite context window. It's strongly recommended to break down tasks such as reading entire modules into smaller chunks. For a focused discussion, use review comments to chat about specific files and their changes, instead of using the PR comments.

### CodeRabbit Commands (Invoked using PR comments)

- `@coderabbitai pause` to pause the reviews on a PR.
- `@coderabbitai resume` to resume the paused reviews.
- `@coderabbitai review` to trigger an incremental review. This is useful when automatic reviews are disabled for the repository.
- `@coderabbitai full review` to do a full review from scratch and review all the files again.
- `@coderabbitai summary` to regenerate the summary of the PR.
- `@coderabbitai resolve` resolve all the CodeRabbit review comments.
- `@coderabbitai configuration` to show the current CodeRabbit configuration for the repository.
- `@coderabbitai help` to get help.

### Other keywords and placeholders
