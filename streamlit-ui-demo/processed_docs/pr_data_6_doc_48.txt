## PR Summary

The pull request titled "fix(deps): overrides RA utils pkg" was created by the user wingkwong and aims to resolve a dependency issue related to the RA utils package. It is linked to issue #3535, which reports a compilation error when importing components from NextUI due to a missing export in the `react-aria` package. The PR follows a standard template, encouraging contributors to describe their changes, the current behavior being modified, and the new behavior introduced. However, the description lacks specific details about the current and new behavior, as well as any potential breaking changes. The primary focus of this PR is to enhance dependency management by addressing the packaging issue associated with the RA utils.

## Objectives from Linked Issues

The linked issue #3535 describes a bug encountered in NextUI version 2.4.6, where users face a compilation error when importing components such as `Card`, `Button`, and others from the `@nextui-org/react` package. The error message indicates that there is no matching export for `getSyntheticLinkProps` in the `react-aria` package, which is causing the compilation failure. The issue was raised after following the automatic installation steps for NextUI and attempting to render the imported components. The user suspects that the problem may stem from a packaging issue within NextUI, as a similar issue has been reported with the `react-aria` library. The objective of the linked issue is to identify and resolve the underlying cause of this compilation error to ensure a smooth development experience without such issues.

<summary>Tips</summary>

### Chat

There are 3 ways to chat with [CodeRabbit](https://coderabbit.ai):

- Review comments: Directly reply to a review comment made by CodeRabbit. Example:
	- `I pushed a fix in commit <commit_id>.`
	- `Generate unit testing code for this file.`
	- `Open a follow-up GitHub issue for this discussion.`
- Files and specific lines of code (under the "Files changed" tab): Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new review comment at the desired location with your query. Examples:
	- `@coderabbitai generate unit testing code for this file.`
	-	`@coderabbitai modularize this function.`
- PR comments: Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new PR comment to ask questions about the PR branch. For the best results, please provide a very specific query, as very limited context is provided in this mode. Examples:
	- `@coderabbitai generate interesting stats about this repository and render them as a table.`
	- `@coderabbitai show all the console.log statements in this repository.`
	- `@coderabbitai read src/utils.ts and generate unit testing code.`
	- `@coderabbitai read the files in the src/scheduler package and generate a class diagram using mermaid and a README in the markdown format.`
	- `@coderabbitai help me debug CodeRabbit configuration file.`

Note: Be mindful of the bot's finite context window. It's strongly recommended to break down tasks such as reading entire modules into smaller chunks. For a focused discussion, use review comments to chat about specific files and their changes, instead of using the PR comments.

### CodeRabbit Commands (invoked as PR comments)

- `@coderabbitai pause` to pause the reviews on a PR.
- `@coderabbitai resume` to resume the paused reviews.
- `@coderabbitai review` to trigger an incremental review. This is useful when automatic reviews are disabled for the repository.
- `@coderabbitai full review` to do a full review from scratch and review all the files again.
- `@coderabbitai summary` to regenerate the summary of the PR.
- `@coderabbitai resolve` resolve all the CodeRabbit review comments.
- `@coderabbitai configuration` to show the current CodeRabbit configuration for the repository.
- `@coderabbitai help` to get help.


Additionally, you can add `@coderabbitai ignore` anywhere in the PR description to prevent this PR from being reviewed.

### CodeRabbit Configuration File (`.coderabbit.yaml`)

- You can programmatically configure CodeRabbit by adding a `.coderabbit.yaml` file to the root of your repository.
- Please see the [configuration documentation](https://docs.coderabbit.ai/guides/configure-coderabbit) for more information.
- If your editor has YAML language server enabled, you can add the path at the top of this file to enable auto-completion and validation: `# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://coderabbit.ai/integrations/schema.v2.json`

### Documentation and Community
