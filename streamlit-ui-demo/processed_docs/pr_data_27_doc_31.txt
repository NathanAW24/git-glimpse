Description:
When trying to replicate the example it will fail since in the example the React instance is being requested in:
     return {
                ...initialProps,
                styles: React.Children.toArray([initialProps.styles])
     //                  ^
};
  }
and this at no time matters

Closes # 
📝 Description

When trying to replicate the example it will fail since in the example the React instance is being requested and this at no time matters

⛳️ Current behavior (updates)

I add the line import React from 'react'

🚀 New behavior

Please describe the behavior or changes this PR adds

At the time of following the steps and copying and pasting the example, this error will stop appearing

💣 Is this a breaking change (Yes/No):  No

📝 Additional Information
It's something simple that users can add, but for novice programmers it can be a headache to understand what is going wrong, and the idea that the learning curve or creating your project can be as simple as copy and paste.
