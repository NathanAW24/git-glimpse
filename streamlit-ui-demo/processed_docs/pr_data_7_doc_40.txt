## Walkthrough

The update addresses a bug where the CardHeader component in the `@nextui-org/theme` had an unintended z-index of 10 by default. The change removes the `z-10` class from the CardHeader styles, ensuring it behaves consistently with other components like CardBody and CardFooter, which do not have a z-index applied by default.

## PR summary

**Title:** fix(card): removed the default z-10 of card header

**User:** abhinandan-verma

**Number:** 3445

**URL:** [https://github.com/nextui-org/nextui/pull/3445](https://github.com/nextui-org/nextui/pull/3445)

**Description:**
- The pull request aims to remove the `z-10` property from the CardHeader component in the NextUI library.
- This modification is intended to align the behavior of CardHeader with other components like CardBody and CardFooter, which do not have a z-index set by default.
- The change is not a breaking change, so it should not impact existing users negatively.
- The PR closes issue #3198.

## Objectives from linked issues

**Issue #3198:** [BUG] - CardHeader z-index =10 by default

**Objectives:**
- The issue describes an unexpected behavior where the CardHeader component has a default z-index of 10.
- This default z-index causes the CardHeader to be displayed on top of other components, such as a sticky header with a z-index of 2, which is not the expected behavior.
- The issue highlights the inconsistency between CardHeader and other components like CardBody and CardFooter, which do not have a default z-index.
- The objective is to remove the default z-index from CardHeader to ensure it behaves consistently with other card components and does not interfere with other UI elements.

<summary>Tips</summary>

### Chat

There are 3 ways to chat with [CodeRabbit](https://coderabbit.ai):

- Review comments: Directly reply to a review comment made by CodeRabbit. Example:
	- `I pushed a fix in commit <commit_id>.`
	- `Generate unit testing code for this file.`
	- `Open a follow-up GitHub issue for this discussion.`
- Files and specific lines of code (under the "Files changed" tab): Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new review comment at the desired location with your query. Examples:
	- `@coderabbitai generate unit testing code for this file.`
	-	`@coderabbitai modularize this function.`
- PR comments: Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new PR comment to ask questions about the PR branch. For the best results, please provide a very specific query, as very limited context is provided in this mode. Examples:
	- `@coderabbitai generate interesting stats about this repository and render them as a table.`
	- `@coderabbitai show all the console.log statements in this repository.`
	- `@coderabbitai read src/utils.ts and generate unit testing code.`
	- `@coderabbitai read the files in the src/scheduler package and generate a class diagram using mermaid and a README in the markdown format.`
	- `@coderabbitai help me debug CodeRabbit configuration file.`

Note: Be mindful of the bot's finite context window. It's strongly recommended to break down tasks such as reading entire modules into smaller chunks. For a focused discussion, use review comments to chat about specific files and their changes, instead of using the PR comments.

### CodeRabbit Commands (invoked as PR comments)

- `@coderabbitai pause` to pause the reviews on a PR.
- `@coderabbitai resume` to resume the paused reviews.
- `@coderabbitai review` to trigger an incremental review. This is useful when automatic reviews are disabled for the repository.
- `@coderabbitai full review` to do a full review from scratch and review all the files again.
- `@coderabbitai summary` to regenerate the summary of the PR.
- `@coderabbitai resolve` resolve all the CodeRabbit review comments.
- `@coderabbitai configuration` to show the current CodeRabbit configuration for the repository.
- `@coderabbitai help` to get help.


Additionally, you can add `@coderabbitai ignore` anywhere in the PR description to prevent this PR from being reviewed.

### CodeRabbit Configration File (`.coderabbit.yaml`)

- You can programmatically configure CodeRabbit by adding a `.coderabbit.yaml` file to the root of your repository.
- Please see the [configuration documentation](https://docs.coderabbit.ai/guides/configure-coderabbit) for more information.
- If your editor has YAML language server enabled, you can add the path at the top of this file to enable auto-completion and validation: `# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://coderabbit.ai/integrations/schema.v2.json`
