## Walkthrough

This update introduces several enhancements across various components in the `@nextui-org` library. Key changes include improvements to the hover state of ghost buttons in the `@nextui-org/theme` package, updates to the dependencies of the `@nextui-org/accordion` and `@nextui-org/autocomplete` packages, and modifications to the styling logic in several components. Additionally, the handling of interaction behaviors, such as closing popovers and dropdowns, has been refined to improve user experience.

packages/components/date-picker/src/use-date-range-picker.ts: ## AI-generated summary of changes

The diff introduces a new utility function, `ariaShouldCloseOnInteractOutside`, which enhances the behavior of the date range picker component by determining whether the popover should close when interacting outside of it. This functionality is integrated into the `useDateRangePicker` hook, specifically within the `popoverProps` configuration. The `shouldCloseOnInteractOutside` property is conditionally set based on the presence of a corresponding prop. If the prop is not provided, it defaults to using the newly imported utility function to manage the closing behavior based on interactions with the specified element and the popover trigger reference. This change improves the user experience by ensuring that the popover behaves correctly in response to user interactions outside of its bounds.

## Alterations to the declarations of exported or public entities

- Added: `shouldCloseOnInteractOutside` in `useDateRangePicker<T extends DateValue>` in `packages/components/date-picker/src/use-date-range-picker.ts`

Two new functions, `getMenuItem` and `getCloseOnSelect`, are added to streamline the retrieval of menu items and their associated properties, specifically focusing on the `closeOnSelect` behavior. The `getMenuItem` function consolidates the logic for finding a menu item based on its key, while `getCloseOnSelect` determines whether the dropdown should close upon selecting an item, taking into account both the item-specific and general dropdown properties.

Additionally, the `onAction` handler within the `useDropdown` function is updated to utilize the new `getCloseOnSelect` function. This change enhances the clarity and maintainability of the code by removing the previous inline logic for determining the `closeOnSelect` behavior. The `shouldCloseOnInteractOutside` property is also introduced to allow for more flexible interaction handling, leveraging the `ariaShouldCloseOnInteractOutside` utility.

packages/components/modal/__tests__/modal.test.tsx: ## AI-generated summary of changes

The provided diff indicates the removal of a test case from the `modal.test.tsx` file, specifically the test that verified the behavior of multiple modals. The deleted test was designed to ensure that only the top-most modal would close when clicking outside of it, while the underlying modal remained open.

packages/components/popover/src/popover-content.tsx: ## AI-generated summary of changes

The changes in the `popover-content.tsx` file introduce a new functionality related to scroll management when the popover is open. Specifically, the `RemoveScroll` component from the `react-remove-scroll` library has been integrated to conditionally block scrolling of the underlying content when the popover is active. This is controlled by the `shouldBlockScroll` and `isOpen` props. The rendering logic for the popover content has been modified to wrap the existing content in the `RemoveScroll` component, which enables or disables scroll blocking based on the state of the popover. The previous implementation did not account for scroll management, which could lead to a less optimal user experience when the popover is displayed. The overall structure of the content rendering remains similar, but the addition of scroll management enhances the functionality of the popover.

## Alterations to the declarations of exported or public entities

- Added: `isOpen` in `PopoverContentProps` in `packages/components/popover/src/popover-content.tsx`
- Added: `shouldBlockScroll` in `PopoverContentProps` in `packages/components/popover/src/popover-content.tsx`

---

packages/components/popover/src/use-aria-popover.ts: ## AI-generated summary of changes

The diff introduces several modifications to the `useReactAriaPopover` function in the `use-aria-popover.ts` file, primarily focusing on the integration of the `useOverlay` hook from `@react-aria/overlays` in place of the previously used `useAriaOverlay` from `@nextui-org/use-aria-overlay`. This change alters how overlay properties are managed, specifically in the context of popover behavior. 

The `shouldCloseOnInteractOutside` logic has been refined; it now utilizes the `ariaShouldCloseOnInteractOutside` utility function to determine if the popover should close when interacting outside of it. This adjustment enhances the flexibility of the closing behavior by allowing for a more nuanced interaction model, as it can now leverage the trigger reference and the state of the popover. 

Additionally, the import statements have been updated to reflect the new dependencies, including the addition of `useOverlay` and `ariaShouldCloseOnInteractOutside`, which are critical for the new functionality. The overall structure of the function remains intact, but the underlying logic for handling overlay interactions has been improved.

## Alterations to the declarations of exported or public entities

- Renamed: `const {overlayProps, underlayProps} = useAriaOverlay(...)` in `use-aria-popover.ts` ‚Üí `const {overlayProps, underlayProps} = useOverlay(...)` in `use-aria-popover.ts`
- Added: `import {useOverlay} from "@react-aria/overlays"` in `use-aria-popover.ts`
- Added: `import {ariaShouldCloseOnInteractOutside} from "@nextui-org/aria-utils"` in `use-aria-popover.ts`

---

packages/components/popover/src/use-popover.ts: ## AI-generated summary of changes

The changes in the `use-popover.ts` file introduce a new effect that manages the visibility of the popover in relation to the DOM reference. Specifically, the `useEffect` hook is added to handle the `ariaHideOutside` functionality, which is invoked when the popover is open and the DOM reference is available. This ensures that the popover is properly hidden from assistive technologies when it is not in focus, enhancing accessibility. Additionally, the `usePreventScroll` hook has been removed, and its functionality is replaced with the new `shouldBlockScroll` property being returned from the `usePopover` function. This indicates a shift in how scroll blocking is managed, potentially allowing for more flexible control over scroll behavior when the popover is active.

Overall, these changes enhance the accessibility and usability of the popover component by ensuring that it behaves correctly in terms of focus management and scroll prevention.

## Alterations to the declarations of exported or public entities

- Added: `shouldBlockScroll` in the return object of `usePopover(originalProps: UsePopoverProps)` in `packages/components/popover/src/use-popover.ts`

packages/components/select/src/use-select.ts: ## AI-generated summary of changes

The diff introduces a new import statement for the `ariaShouldCloseOnInteractOutside` function from the `@nextui-org/aria-utils` package. This function is integrated into the `useSelect` function, specifically within the configuration of the `popoverProps`. The change allows for a more flexible handling of the `shouldCloseOnInteractOutside` property. If this property is provided in `popoverProps`, it will be used directly; otherwise, the function `ariaShouldCloseOnInteractOutside` will be utilized to determine whether the popover should close based on interactions outside of it. This modification enhances the control over the popover's behavior in response to user interactions, potentially improving the user experience by ensuring that the popover closes appropriately when interacting outside of it.

## Alterations to the declarations of exported or public entities

- Added: `shouldCloseOnInteractOutside` in the `PopoverProps` configuration within the `useSelect` function in `packages/components/select/src/use-select.ts`

packages/components/tooltip/src/use-tooltip.ts: ## AI-generated summary of changes

The changes in the `use-tooltip.ts` file primarily involve the removal of the `shouldBlockScroll` property from the `Props` interface and its associated logic. This property, which previously controlled whether scrolling outside the tooltip should be blocked, has been eliminated from both the interface definition and the implementation of the `useTooltip` function. Consequently, the `usePreventScroll` hook call that depended on this property has also been removed, indicating that the tooltip will no longer have the capability to block scrolling behavior when it is open. This modification simplifies the tooltip's functionality by removing a feature that may have been deemed unnecessary or redundant.

The overall structure of the tooltip functionality remains intact, but the removal of the scroll-blocking feature alters how the tooltip interacts with the surrounding UI, potentially allowing for a more fluid user experience without the constraints of scroll prevention.

packages/core/theme/src/components/button.ts: ## AI-generated summary of changes

The diff introduces a modification to the class definitions for the "ghost" variant of a button component in the `button.ts` file. Specifically, the change enhances the hover state styling by adding a new class for the text color when the button is hovered over. The original class definition for the "ghost" variant with the "danger" color included a hover state for the background color but only specified the text color as part of the existing class.

packages/hooks/use-aria-menu/src/use-menu-item.ts: ## AI-generated summary of changes

The diff introduces a modification to the `onAction` property within the `AriaMenuItemProps` interface in the `use-menu-item.ts` file. Previously, the `onAction` handler accepted a single parameter, `key`, which represented the key associated with the action. The updated signature now requires two parameters: `key` and `item`. This change enhances the functionality of the `onAction` handler by providing additional context about the menu item being activated, allowing for more nuanced handling of actions based on the specific item.

In the implementation of the `useMenuItem` function, the calls to `onAction` have been updated accordingly to pass both the `key` and the `item` parameters.

packages/hooks/use-aria-multiselect/src/use-multiselect.ts: ## AI-generated summary of changes

The diff indicates the removal of a specific event handler within the `useMultiSelect` function in the `use-multiselect.ts` file. The deleted code block was responsible for handling the `onPressStart` event for `menuTriggerProps`. This event handler checked the `pointerType` of the event and, if it was neither "touch" nor "keyboard" and the component was not disabled, it toggled the state based on the pointer type. The removal of this functionality suggests a change in how user interactions are managed, particularly regarding pointer events, which may affect the component's responsiveness to user input.

The overall control flow is altered by this deletion, as the component will no longer respond to the `onPressStart` event in the same manner, potentially leading to a different user experience when interacting with the multi-select component.
