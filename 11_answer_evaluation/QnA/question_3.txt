Issue:
Interactive elements such as MenuItem, ListboxItem, Link, and Button use the onClick event handler, leading to inconsistencies in behavior across devices, particularly on mobile. Additionally, some internal utilities are outdated, and unnecessary dependencies increase the bundle size. The lack of alignment with modern accessibility standards exacerbates these problems.

Question:
"Given the above issue, how would you implement a solution to address inconsistent onClick event handling in interactive components, ensuring alignment with modern accessibility standards, improved performance, backward compatibility, and reduced bundle size?"
