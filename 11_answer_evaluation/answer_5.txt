### General Answer Structure

#### 1. Investigation / Analysis
**Contextual Review:**  
The issue arises because the `helper-wrapper` div is being rendered unnecessarily when `isInvalid` is `false` but either `errorMessage` or `description` is present. This causes layout shifts, leading to a sliding problem in the UI.

**Inspection of Existing Code and Behavior:**  
- Current behavior: The `helper-wrapper` div is always created based on partial validation conditions, which results in unnecessary rendering.  
- Affected components: `Input`, `Textarea`, and `Select`.

**Relevant Files (to look at):**
- `packages/components/input/src/input.tsx`: Contains logic for rendering helper wrappers in the Input component.  
- `packages/components/input/src/textarea.tsx`: Manages the rendering logic for helper text in the Textarea component.  
- `packages/components/select/src/select.tsx`: Handles the helper wrapper logic for the Select component.  

**Error Analysis:**  
The issue stems from incomplete conditional logic for rendering helper wrappers. The helper wrapper is being rendered even when `isInvalid` is `false`, which leads to layout instability and unintended sliding effects in the UI.

#### 2. Proposed Solution / Implementation Steps
**Files to create or add:**  
No new files are required.

**High-Level Changes:**  
Refactor the conditional rendering logic for helper wrappers to ensure that they are only rendered when necessary, i.e., when `isInvalid` is `true` or when `errorMessage` or `description` is provided.

**Specific Technical Steps:**  
1. **Update Conditional Rendering Logic:**  
   - Modify the conditional checks in `input.tsx`, `textarea.tsx`, and `select.tsx` to include all relevant conditions (`isInvalid`, `errorMessage`, and `description`).  
   - Ensure that the `helper-wrapper` div is not rendered if all these conditions are `false`.

2. **Adjust JSX Structure:**  
   - Update the JSX to simplify the rendering logic for helper text and wrappers in the affected files.

3. **Refactor Props and Type Definitions:**  
   - Update the `InputProps` and `SelectProps` type definitions to reflect the refined conditional logic and ensure better clarity for developers.

4. **Enhance Code Readability:**  
   - Refactor the helper-rendering logic into reusable functions or constants for better maintainability.

#### 3. Post-Fix / Post-Implementation Checks
**Testing and Verification:**  
- **Unit Tests:**  
   - Add or update unit tests to validate that the `helper-wrapper` div renders only when necessary.  
   - Test for various combinations of `isInvalid`, `errorMessage`, and `description` to ensure coverage of edge cases.  

- **User Interaction Tests:**  
   - Verify that the sliding issue is resolved and that there are no unintended layout shifts.

- **Performance and Reliability:**  
   - Confirm that rendering optimizations improve visual stability without introducing new issues.

#### 4. Documentation and Communication
**Update Documentation:**  
- Add clear examples in the documentation showing the expected behavior of the `helper-wrapper` div based on different prop combinations.

**Add Release Notes:**  
- Include an entry in the projectâ€™s CHANGELOG highlighting:  
   - The bug fix for the `helper-wrapper` rendering issue.  
   - The improvement in visual stability for `Input`, `Textarea`, and `Select` components.  

**Developer Communication:**  
- Inform team members about the changes during the next sprint meeting or via internal communication channels.
