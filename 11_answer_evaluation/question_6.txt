Issue: The Popover component in the NextUI library currently lacks a feature to control whether it should close when the user scrolls, potentially leading to unwanted behavior in certain scenarios.

Question: How would you implement a feature in the Popover component that allows developers to control whether the popover closes when the user scrolls, ensuring flexibility for various use cases? The solution should include updates to the component's API, documentation, tests, and examples.
