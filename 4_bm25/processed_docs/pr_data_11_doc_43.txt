### PR Objectives

This pull request (PR #2861) addresses issues #2820 and #2857, which involve a "Maximum update depth exceeded" error encountered in the `Calendar` and `RangeCalendar` components of the NextUI library. The error was triggered when users hovered quickly over dates within these components.

The primary objective of this PR is to resolve this error by modifying the state management approach within the `CalendarMonth` component. Previously, the component managed its state independently, which contributed to the excessive re-rendering and ultimately led to the error. The PR removes this self-managed state and instead relies on the state provided by the context, simplifying the component's structure and reducing unnecessary re-render complexity.

The changes are encapsulated in the `calendar-month.tsx` file, where the self-controlled state and its associated `useEffect` hook have been removed. This adjustment is expected to enhance performance and prevent the occurrence of the maximum update depth error by streamlining state management.

The PR includes a changeset file (`tasty-keys-cover.md`) that outlines the patch for fixing the identified issues. It confirms that the changes are not breaking and do not require any migration steps for existing users of NextUI.

An image in the PR description illustrates the problematic behavior in the current version, highlighting the urgency and relevance of the fix. The PR is categorized under bug fixes, focusing solely on resolving the specific error without introducing new features or dependencies.

### AI-Generated Summary of Generated Summaries

The PR makes a critical update to the `CalendarMonth` component in the `calendar-month.tsx` file by removing its self-managed state and associated `useEffect` hook. This change simplifies the component's state management by relying solely on the context-provided state, thereby addressing the "Maximum update depth exceeded" error previously encountered when users hovered over dates rapidly. This modification not only resolves the error but also enhances the clarity and efficiency of the component's operation within the NextUI library.

### Chat

There are 3 ways to chat with [CodeRabbit](https://coderabbit.ai):

- Review comments: Directly reply to a review comment made by CodeRabbit. Example:
	- `I pushed a fix in commit <commit_id>.`
	- `Generate unit testing code for this file.`
	- `Open a follow-up GitHub issue for this discussion.`
- Files and specific lines of code (under the "Files changed" tab): Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new review comment at the desired location with your query. Examples:
	- `@coderabbitai generate unit testing code for this file.`
	-	`@coderabbitai modularize this function.`
- PR comments: Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new PR comment to ask questions about the PR branch. For the best results, please provide a very specific query, as very limited context is provided in this mode. Examples:
	- `@coderabbitai generate interesting stats about this repository and render them as a table.`
	- `@coderabbitai show all the console.log statements in this repository.`
	- `@coderabbitai read src/utils.ts and generate unit testing code.`
	- `@coderabbitai read the files in the src/scheduler package and generate a class diagram using mermaid and a README in the markdown format.`

Note: Be mindful of the bot's finite context window. It's strongly recommended to break down tasks such as reading entire modules into smaller chunks. For a focused discussion, use review comments to chat about specific files and their changes, instead of using the PR comments.

### CodeRabbit Commands (invoked as PR comments)

- `@coderabbitai pause` to pause the reviews on a PR.
- `@coderabbitai resume` to resume the paused reviews.
- `@coderabbitai review` to trigger a review. This is useful when automatic reviews are disabled for the repository.
- `@coderabbitai resolve` resolve all the CodeRabbit review comments.
- `@coderabbitai help` to get help.


Additionally, you can add `@coderabbitai ignore` anywhere in the PR description to prevent this PR from being reviewed.

### CodeRabbit Configration File (`.coderabbit.yaml`)

- You can programmatically configure CodeRabbit by adding a `.coderabbit.yaml` file to the root of your repository.
