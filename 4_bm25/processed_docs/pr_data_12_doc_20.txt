### PR Objectives (User Provided Facts)

This pull request, numbered 2793 and titled "fix(input): clear feature fix #2791," addresses a bug in the NextUI library where the input clear button was not functioning correctly. The issue, documented under #2791, describes a scenario where the input field fails to visually clear the text even though the value is set to empty. This problem was reproducible on the NextUI documentation page for the input component with a clear button.

The pull request proposes a change in the handling of the `value` property within the `useInput` function of the input component. Previously, the value was determined by `domRef?.current?.value ?? inputValue`, which did not reflect changes when the input was supposed to be cleared. The proposed fix simplifies this assignment to just `inputValue`, ensuring that the state and the visual representation of the input field are consistent.

The description includes before and after screenshots hosted on the NextUI GitHub repository, visually demonstrating the issue and the effect of the proposed fix. The change is encapsulated in a new changeset file and modifications to the `use-input.ts` file within the input component's package.

The pull request does not specify whether this modification is a breaking change, leaving this assessment to further review or testing. Additional information provided in the PR is minimal, focusing solely on the description of the change and its immediate impact.

### AI-Generated Summary of Generated Summaries

The pull request introduces a patch to the `@nextui-org/input` component, specifically targeting the functionality of the input clear feature. The core modification involves a simplification in the assignment of the `value` property within the `useInput` function. Instead of deriving the value from the DOM reference or a fallback to `inputValue`, the update directly assigns `inputValue` as the value. This change aims to ensure that the visual state of the input field accurately reflects its actual data state, particularly after using the clear button. This adjustment is documented in both a new changeset file and the `use-input.ts` file, highlighting the focused nature of the fix on improving user interaction consistency.

### Chat

There are 3 ways to chat with [CodeRabbit](https://coderabbit.ai):

- Review comments: Directly reply to a review comment made by CodeRabbit. Example:
	- `I pushed a fix in commit <commit_id>.`
	- `Generate unit testing code for this file.`
	- `Open a follow-up GitHub issue for this discussion.`
- Files and specific lines of code (under the "Files changed" tab): Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new review comment at the desired location with your query. Examples:
	- `@coderabbitai generate unit testing code for this file.`
	-	`@coderabbitai modularize this function.`
- PR comments: Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new PR comment to ask questions about the PR branch. For the best results, please provide a very specific query, as very limited context is provided in this mode. Examples:
	- `@coderabbitai generate interesting stats about this repository and render them as a table.`
	- `@coderabbitai show all the console.log statements in this repository.`
	- `@coderabbitai read src/utils.ts and generate unit testing code.`
	- `@coderabbitai read the files in the src/scheduler package and generate a class diagram using mermaid and a README in the markdown format.`

Note: Be mindful of the bot's finite context window. It's strongly recommended to break down tasks such as reading entire modules into smaller chunks. For a focused discussion, use review comments to chat about specific files and their changes, instead of using the PR comments.

### CodeRabbit Commands (invoked as PR comments)

- `@coderabbitai pause` to pause the reviews on a PR.
- `@coderabbitai resume` to resume the paused reviews.
- `@coderabbitai review` to trigger a review. This is useful when automatic reviews are disabled for the repository.
- `@coderabbitai resolve` resolve all the CodeRabbit review comments.
- `@coderabbitai help` to get help.


Additionally, you can add `@coderabbitai ignore` anywhere in the PR description to prevent this PR from being reviewed.
