## Walkthrough
The changes introduce new TypeScript components for dropdown menus with single and multiple selection capabilities, enhancing user interactivity. The dropdowns utilize React hooks for state management and include options for various data types. Additionally, documentation updates improve clarity regarding installation commands and component properties, including the removal of the `disallowEmptySelection` property from the `Tabs` component.

apps/docs/content/components/dropdown/multiple-selection.ts: ## AI-generated summary of changes

The diff introduces a new TypeScript component for a dropdown menu with multiple selection capabilities, enhancing the existing functionality. The new `AppTs` component utilizes React hooks to manage the state of selected items, specifically using a `Set` to store the keys of selected dropdown items. The selected values are displayed in a button, formatted as a comma-separated string with underscores replaced by spaces. The dropdown menu allows for multiple selections, with options for "Text," "Number," "Date," "Single Date," and "Iteration." The component is designed to prevent empty selections and allows users to select multiple items simultaneously. This addition significantly expands the dropdown's functionality compared to the previous implementation.

## Alterations to the declarations of exported or public entities

- Added: `export default function App()` in `App.tsx`

---

apps/docs/content/components/dropdown/single-selection.ts: ## AI-generated summary of changes

The diff introduces a new TypeScript component, `AppTs`, which implements a dropdown menu with single selection functionality using the NextUI library. This component maintains the selected state using a `Set` to store selected keys, initialized with a default value of "text". The selected value is computed using `React.useMemo`, which converts the `Set` into a string, replacing underscores with spaces for display purposes. The dropdown menu allows users to select from multiple options, including "Text", "Number", "Date", "Single Date", and "Iteration". The `DropdownMenu` is configured to disallow empty selections and to operate in single selection mode, updating the selected keys through the `onSelectionChange` handler. This addition enhances the application's interactivity by providing a user-friendly interface for selecting options.

## Alterations to the declarations of exported or public entities

- Added: `export default function App()` in `AppTs` in `apps/docs/content/components/dropdown/single-selection.ts`

---

apps/docs/content/components/table/async-pagination.ts: ## AI-generated summary of changes

The diff introduces two notable changes in the `async-pagination.ts` file. First, the `useMemo` hook is now explicitly referenced as `React.useMemo`, which clarifies the origin of the hook and enhances code readability. This change does not alter the functionality but improves the clarity of the code by making it explicit that `useMemo` is a part of the React library. 

Second, a spread operator `{...args}` has been removed from a component, which could potentially affect how props are passed to that component. This change may impact the behavior of the component if `args` contained important properties that were previously being forwarded. The removal of this spread operator suggests a modification in how the component interacts with its parent or surrounding context, which could lead to differences in rendering or functionality.

Overall, these changes enhance clarity and may alter component behavior due to the removal of prop spreading.

## Alterations to the declarations of exported or public entities

- No alterations to the declarations of exported or public entities were made in this diff.

---

apps/docs/content/docs/components/dropdown.mdx: ## AI-generated summary of changes

The diff reflects a minor modification in the documentation for the dropdown component, specifically in the `CodeDemo` sections for single and multiple selection modes. The highlighted lines for both examples have been removed, which may indicate a decision to streamline the presentation of the code demos by eliminating specific line highlights. This change does not alter the functionality or logic of the dropdown component itself but modifies how the examples are presented in the documentation.

## Alterations to the declarations of exported or public entities

- No alterations to the declarations of exported or public entities were made in this diff.

---

apps/docs/content/docs/components/tabs.mdx: ## AI-generated summary of changes

The diff reflects a modification in the documentation for the `Tabs` component, specifically the removal of the `disallowEmptySelection` property from the list of customizable properties. This property previously indicated whether the tabs should allow an empty selection, with a default value of `false`. The removal suggests a shift in the component's design philosophy, potentially indicating that empty selection is now either implicitly allowed or managed differently within the component's logic. The remaining properties, such as `shouldSelectOnPressUp`, `keyboardActivation`, and `motionProps`, remain unchanged, indicating that the core functionality of the `Tabs` component is preserved while the handling of empty selections has been altered.

## Alterations to the declarations of exported or public entities

- Removed: `disallowEmptySelection | boolean` in the `Tabs` component props documentation.

---

apps/docs/content/docs/guide/cli.mdx: ## AI-generated summary of changes

The changes in the provided diff enhance the documentation for using the CLI without a global installation. The previous method of using `npx` is replaced with a more structured approach that utilizes a `<PackageManagers>` component. This component now presents commands for various package managers (npm, yarn, pnpm, bun) in a consistent format, improving clarity and usability. The installation steps for dependencies and starting the local server are similarly updated to use the `<PackageManagers>` component, which standardizes the presentation of commands across different package managers. This change not only improves the readability of the documentation but also ensures that users can easily find the appropriate command for their preferred package manager.

## Alterations to the declarations of exported or public entities

- Added: `<PackageManagers>` component for CLI usage without global installation in `apps/docs/content/docs/guide/cli.mdx`
- Added: `<PackageManagers>` component for installing dependencies in `apps/docs/content/docs/guide/cli.mdx`
- Added: `<PackageManagers>` component for starting the local server in `apps/docs/content/docs/guide/cli.mdx`

---

apps/docs/content/docs/guide/installation.mdx: ## AI-generated summary of changes

The changes in the provided diff replace the previous method of installing dependencies and starting the local server with a more structured approach using a `PackageManagers` component. This component encapsulates the commands for various package managers (npm, yarn, pnpm, bun) in a single, reusable format. The installation commands for dependencies and the command to start the local server have been consolidated into this new component, enhancing clarity and maintainability. The previous inline code blocks have been removed in favor of this new structure, which allows for a more consistent presentation of commands across different package managers.

## Alterations to the declarations of exported or public entities

- Added: `<PackageManagers>` component in `apps/docs/content/docs/guide/installation.mdx` for managing installation and server start commands across multiple package managers.

---

apps/docs/components/docs/components/component-links.tsx: ## AI-generated summary of changes

The diff introduces a new section within the `ComponentLinks` component of the `component-links.tsx` file. This section includes a link to a Product Hunt page featuring "Zigma by NextUI," along with an embedded image that serves as a promotional badge. The addition consists of a `div` element that contains an anchor (`<a>`) tag linking to the Product Hunt post, which opens in a new tab and includes a `rel` attribute for security. Inside the anchor tag, an image (`<img>`) is displayed, which is sourced from the Product Hunt API and is styled to fit within specified dimensions. Below the image, a paragraph (`<p>`) provides a brief message encouraging users to engage with the Product Hunt listing, emphasizing the goal of achieving the #1 Product of the Day status. This change enhances the component's functionality by promoting an external product and encouraging user interaction.

## Alterations to the declarations of exported or public entities

- No alterations to the declarations of exported or public entities were made in this diff.

apps/docs/components/marketing/hero/hero.tsx: ## AI-generated summary of changes

The diff introduces a new section within the `Hero` component of the `hero.tsx` file, which promotes a product featured on Product Hunt. This section includes a link to the product's page, accompanied by an embedded image badge and a brief promotional message encouraging users to participate in the conversation and support the product. The new content is structured using a flexbox layout, ensuring proper alignment and spacing. This addition enhances the marketing capabilities of the component by directly engaging users with a call to action related to the product's launch.

## Alterations to the declarations of exported or public entities

- No alterations to the declarations of exported or public entities were made in this diff.

---

apps/docs/content/docs/components/avatar.mdx: ## AI-generated summary of changes

The diff indicates the removal of two blank lines in the documentation for the Avatar component, which is used to represent a user and display their profile picture. This change does not affect the functionality or logic of the component itself, as it pertains solely to formatting within the documentation.

## Alterations to the declarations of exported or public entities

- No alterations to the declarations of exported or public entities were made.

`132-152`: **LGTM!**

The code changes look good to me. The new section is correctly implemented and does not introduce any issues. The link opens in a new tab with the appropriate `rel` attribute, the image is properly sourced and styled, and the paragraph provides a clear call-to-action.

The addition is self-contained and does not affect the existing functionality of the `ComponentLinks` component.

### Chat

There are 3 ways to chat with [CodeRabbit](https://coderabbit.ai):

- Review comments: Directly reply to a review comment made by CodeRabbit. Example:
	- `I pushed a fix in commit <commit_id>.`
	- `Generate unit testing code for this file.`
	- `Open a follow-up GitHub issue for this discussion.`
- Files and specific lines of code (under the "Files changed" tab): Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new review comment at the desired location with your query. Examples:
	- `@coderabbitai generate unit testing code for this file.`
	-	`@coderabbitai modularize this function.`
- PR comments: Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new PR comment to ask questions about the PR branch. For the best results, please provide a very specific query, as very limited context is provided in this mode. Examples:
	- `@coderabbitai generate interesting stats about this repository and render them as a table.`
	- `@coderabbitai show all the console.log statements in this repository.`
	- `@coderabbitai read src/utils.ts and generate unit testing code.`
	- `@coderabbitai read the files in the src/scheduler package and generate a class diagram using mermaid and a README in the markdown format.`
	- `@coderabbitai help me debug CodeRabbit configuration file.`

Note: Be mindful of the bot's finite context window. It's strongly recommended to break down tasks such as reading entire modules into smaller chunks. For a focused discussion, use review comments to chat about specific files and their changes, instead of using the PR comments.
