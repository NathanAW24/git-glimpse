packages/components/calendar/package.json: ## AI-generated summary of changes

The provided diff for `packages/components/calendar/package.json` reflects updates to the dependencies and devDependencies sections. Notably, new dependencies have been added, including `@internationalized/date`, `@nextui-org/button`, and `@nextui-org/framer-utils`, while the order of some existing dependencies has been rearranged. The dependency on `@nextui-org/shared-utils` has been retained, but the previous entry for `@nextui-org/framer-utils` has been removed, indicating a consolidation of dependencies. In the devDependencies section, `@nextui-org/system` and `@nextui-org/theme` have been added back after being removed in a previous iteration, while `framer-motion` has been moved to a new position. The overall structure and organization of dependencies have been refined, but the core functionality remains intact. These changes are primarily focused on dependency management rather than altering the underlying logic of the codebase.

packages/components/calendar/src/calendar-base.tsx: ## AI-generated summary of changes

The changes in the `calendar-base.tsx` file introduce a new dependency on the `useIsMobile` hook from the `@nextui-org/use-is-mobile` package, which enhances the responsiveness of the calendar component. This hook is utilized to determine if the current device is mobile, influencing the rendering logic of the calendar's header and buttons. The adjustments also modify the structure of the calendar's rendering logic, ensuring that the calendar adapts its interface based on the device type. These changes reflect a significant enhancement in the component's functionality, improving the user experience on mobile devices by providing appropriate navigation controls.

## Alterations to the declarations of exported or public entities

The changes introduced in the diff enhance the `Props` interface and the `useCalendarBase` function in the `use-calendar-base.ts` file by adding a new property for calendar height. Specifically, a `calendarHeight` property is added to the `Props` interface, which allows users to specify the height of the calendar component. This integration allows for dynamic styling of the calendar component based on the specified height, enhancing its flexibility and usability. Overall, these changes improve the component's configurability by allowing developers to control both the width and height of the calendar.

## Alterations to the declarations of exported or public entities

- `calendarHeight?: number | string` in interface `Props` in `packages/components/calendar/src/use-calendar-base.ts` (added)

## PR Summary

The pull request titled "fix(calendar): vertical appearance in mobile devices" was submitted by the user `awesome-pro` and addresses an issue related to the display of calendars on mobile devices. The PR aims to implement logic that allows multiple calendars to be displayed vertically when viewed on mobile, enhancing usability in this context. The current behavior, as demonstrated in the provided screenshots, shows that the calendars do not stack vertically, leading to usability issues such as the presence of scrollbars. The new behavior proposed in the PR presents the calendars in a column format, eliminating the need for horizontal scrolling and improving the overall user experience. The PR does not introduce any breaking changes, ensuring that existing functionality remains intact for users of the NextUI library.

## Objectives from Linked Issues

The linked issue, titled "It is not possible to change the calendar display on a mobile," outlines specific problems encountered with the calendar display on mobile devices. The issue was reported for NextUI version 2.4.0 and describes the inability to view multiple calendars in a user-friendly manner when using the DateRangePicker component with two visible months. Users reported that when switching to mobile mode, the calendars would not align vertically, resulting in horizontal scrolling and a cumbersome interface. The expected behavior, as articulated in the issue, is for the calendars to be displayed one below the other in a column format, thereby eliminating scrollbars and enhancing accessibility. The PR directly addresses these objectives by implementing the necessary adjustments to ensure that calendars are presented vertically on mobile devices, aligning with user expectations and improving the overall experience.

### Chat

There are 3 ways to chat with [CodeRabbit](https://coderabbit.ai):

- Review comments: Directly reply to a review comment made by CodeRabbit. Example:
	- `I pushed a fix in commit <commit_id>.`
	- `Generate unit testing code for this file.`
	- `Open a follow-up GitHub issue for this discussion.`
- Files and specific lines of code (under the "Files changed" tab): Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new review comment at the desired location with your query. Examples:
	- `@coderabbitai generate unit testing code for this file.`
	-	`@coderabbitai modularize this function.`
- PR comments: Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new PR comment to ask questions about the PR branch. For the best results, please provide a very specific query, as very limited context is provided in this mode. Examples:
	- `@coderabbitai generate interesting stats about this repository and render them as a table.`
	- `@coderabbitai show all the console.log statements in this repository.`
	- `@coderabbitai read src/utils.ts and generate unit testing code.`
	- `@coderabbitai read the files in the src/scheduler package and generate a class diagram using mermaid and a README in the markdown format.`
	- `@coderabbitai help me debug CodeRabbit configuration file.`

Note: Be mindful of the bot's finite context window. It's strongly recommended to break down tasks such as reading entire modules into smaller chunks. For a focused discussion, use review comments to chat about specific files and their changes, instead of using the PR comments.

### CodeRabbit Commands (invoked as PR comments)

- `@coderabbitai full review` to do a full review from scratch and review all the files again.
- `@coderabbitai summary` to regenerate the summary of the PR.
- `@coderabbitai resolve` resolve all the CodeRabbit review comments.
- `@coderabbitai configuration` to show the current CodeRabbit configuration for the repository.
- `@coderabbitai help` to get help.


Additionally, you can add `@coderabbitai ignore` anywhere in the PR description to prevent this PR from being reviewed.

### CodeRabbit Configuration File (`.coderabbit.yaml`)

- You can programmatically configure CodeRabbit by adding a `.coderabbit.yaml` file to the root of your repository.
- Please see the [configuration documentation](https://docs.coderabbit.ai/guides/configure-coderabbit) for more information.
