## Walkthrough

The recent update introduces enhancements to the post-build process for a React project. Specifically, it involves the addition of a new declaration for the Docs components directory path and an update to the logic for extracting style information. This extraction targets MDX component files, aiming to enrich the `componentInfo` object with detailed style data, thereby improving documentation and developer experience.

### PR Objectives

The pull request titled "feat: add style attribute in components.json" (PR #2632) introduces a significant enhancement to the `components.json` file within the NextUI project. The primary objective of this PR is to enrich the `components.json` data by incorporating style attributes for components. This addition aims to provide a more detailed and comprehensive representation of components, facilitating better usage and customization for developers.

The PR includes a visual representation of the new `components.json` data structure, as depicted in an image hosted on GitHub. Although the image's content is not directly described in the PR description, it presumably illustrates the updated JSON structure with the newly added style attributes.

The description outlines the standard protocol for submitting pull requests to the project, emphasizing the importance of keeping PRs concise, focused on a single type of change (in this case, a feature enhancement), and mindful of the project's review process, especially concerning the addition of new external dependencies.

While the PR description mentions placeholders for sections such as "Current behavior (updates)" and "New behavior," specific details about the current and new behaviors resulting from this PR are not provided. Similarly, the sections on whether this change constitutes a breaking change and additional information are left for further elaboration.

The code diff summary highlights modifications made to the `postbuild.js` script within the `packages/core/react/src/scripts/` directory. These changes involve the declaration of a new variable `docsComponentsDir` to specify the directory path for Docs components. More importantly, the script has been updated to extract style information from MDX component files and incorporate this data into the `componentInfo` object. This technical adjustment is crucial for achieving the PR's objective of adding style attributes to the `components.json` file.

### AI-generated Summary of Generated Summaries

The pull request #2632 introduces a feature enhancement to the NextUI project by adding style attributes to the `components.json` file. This enhancement is aimed at providing a richer and more detailed representation of components, specifically by including style information that facilitates better customization and usage by developers. The PR includes an update to the `postbuild.js` script, which now features logic for extracting style information from MDX component files and appending this data to the `componentInfo` object. Additionally, a new variable, `docsComponentsDir`, has been introduced to specify the directory path for Docs components. This change is encapsulated in the broader goal of enriching the `components.json` data structure, as visually represented in the PR description, although specific details about the current and new behaviors, potential breaking changes, and additional information are not explicitly detailed in the provided description.

### Chat

There are 3 ways to chat with [CodeRabbit](https://coderabbit.ai):

- Review comments: Directly reply to a review comment made by CodeRabbit. Example:
	- `I pushed a fix in commit <commit_id>.`
	- `Generate unit testing code for this file.`
	- `Open a follow-up GitHub issue for this discussion.`
- Files and specific lines of code (under the "Files changed" tab): Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new review comment at the desired location with your query. Examples:
	- `@coderabbitai generate unit testing code for this file.`
	-	`@coderabbitai modularize this function.`
- PR comments: Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new PR comment to ask questions about the PR branch. For the best results, please provide a very specific query, as very limited context is provided in this mode. Examples:
	- `@coderabbitai generate interesting stats about this repository and render them as a table.`
	- `@coderabbitai show all the console.log statements in this repository.`
	- `@coderabbitai read src/utils.ts and generate unit testing code.`
	- `@coderabbitai read the files in the src/scheduler package and generate a class diagram using mermaid and a README in the markdown format.`

Note: Be mindful of the bot's finite context window. It's strongly recommended to break down tasks such as reading entire modules into smaller chunks. For a focused discussion, use review comments to chat about specific files and their changes, instead of using the PR comments.

### CodeRabbit Commands (invoked as PR comments)

- `@coderabbitai pause` to pause the reviews on a PR.
- `@coderabbitai resume` to resume the paused reviews.
- `@coderabbitai review` to trigger a review. This is useful when automatic reviews are disabled for the repository.
- `@coderabbitai resolve` resolve all the CodeRabbit review comments.
- `@coderabbitai help` to get help.


Additionally, you can add `@coderabbitai ignore` anywhere in the PR description to prevent this PR from being reviewed.

### CodeRabbit Configration File (`.coderabbit.yaml`)

- You can programmatically configure CodeRabbit by adding a `.coderabbit.yaml` file to the root of your repository.
- Please see the [configuration documentation](https://docs.coderabbit.ai/guides/configure-coderabbit) for more information.
- If your editor has YAML language server enabled, you can add the path at the top of this file to enable auto-completion and validation: `# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://coderabbit.ai/integrations/coderabbit-overrides.v2.json`
