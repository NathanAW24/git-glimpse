Description:
üìù Description
The div when the popover is closed interferes with the exit animation, so this checks for number of items - if there are any items, use null (similar to Select). Otherwise if there are no items, keep default behaviour of rendering an empty hidden div.
In relation to: #2674
‚õ≥Ô∏è Current behavior (updates)
Autocomplete on close doesn't animate.

## Walkthrough
The changes introduce a patch for the `@nextui-org/autocomplete` package, focusing on the behavior of the popover component during exit animations. It ensures that `null` is returned when items are present for exit animations. Additionally, the rendering logic for the `popoverContent` variable in the `Autocomplete` component is modified to render an empty popover when the collection size is zero and the popover is closed, enhancing the control flow of the component.

## AI-generated summary of changes

The changes introduce a patch for the `@nextui-org/autocomplete` package. The primary functionality added is the return of `null` when there are items present for exit animation during the closing of a popover. This modification affects the behavior of the popover component, ensuring that it handles exit animations appropriately when items are involved. The rendering logic of the `popoverContent` variable within the `Autocomplete` component has been modified to include an additional condition that checks the size of the `collection` in `getListBoxProps().state` when `isOpen` is false. If the collection size is zero, it renders an empty popover using `getEmptyPopoverProps()`. If the collection size is not zero, it renders `null`. This adjustment alters the control flow to provide a more specific response when the autocomplete is closed and there are no items in the list. Additionally, the `listboxProps` variable is introduced to store the result of `getListBoxProps()`, which is then used in the rendering of the `Listbox` component.

## Alterations to the declarations of exported or public entities

- Type definition updated: `export type AutocompleteProps<T extends object = object> = Props<T> & {ref?: Ref<HTMLElement>};` in `packages/components/autocomplete/src/autocomplete.tsx` (no change in signature)
- No alterations to the declarations of exported or public entities were made.

## PR Summary

The pull request titled "fix(autocomplete): exit animation on popover close" was submitted by user alexnguyennz and is identified as PR number 3845. The main objective of this PR is to address an issue where the exit animation of the autocomplete component does not function correctly when the popover is closed.

The problem arises because the div that remains when the popover closes interferes with the exit animation. To resolve this, the PR introduces a check for the number of items in the autocomplete. If there are items present, it sets the div to `null`, which aligns with the behavior of the Select component. Conversely, if there are no items, the default behavior of rendering an empty hidden div is maintained.

The PR references a related pull request (PR #2674) and outlines the current behavior where the autocomplete does not animate upon closing. It provides a visual comparison through links to user-attachments showcasing the previous and new behavior, highlighting that the autocomplete now animates correctly on close.

The author confirms that this change is not a breaking change. Additionally, the author mentions testing the functionality with and without the `allowsCustomValue=true` property and with/without `AutocompleteItem`.

For further details, the PR can be accessed at the following URL: [PR #3845](https://github.com/nextui-org/nextui/pull/3845).

### Chat

There are 3 ways to chat with [CodeRabbit](https://coderabbit.ai):

- Review comments: Directly reply to a review comment made by CodeRabbit. Example:
  - `I pushed a fix in commit <commit_id>, please review it.`
  - `Generate unit testing code for this file.`
  - `Open a follow-up GitHub issue for this discussion.`
- Files and specific lines of code (under the "Files changed" tab): Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new review comment at the desired location with your query. Examples:
  - `@coderabbitai generate unit testing code for this file.`
  -	`@coderabbitai modularize this function.`
- PR comments: Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new PR comment to ask questions about the PR branch. For the best results, please provide a very specific query, as very limited context is provided in this mode. Examples:
  - `@coderabbitai gather interesting stats about this repository and render them as a table. Additionally, render a pie chart showing the language distribution in the codebase.`
  - `@coderabbitai read src/utils.ts and generate unit testing code.`
  - `@coderabbitai read the files in the src/scheduler package and generate a class diagram using mermaid and a README in the markdown format.`
  - `@coderabbitai help me debug CodeRabbit configuration file.`

Note: Be mindful of the bot's finite context window. It's strongly recommended to break down tasks such as reading entire modules into smaller chunks. For a focused discussion, use review comments to chat about specific files and their changes, instead of using the PR comments.
