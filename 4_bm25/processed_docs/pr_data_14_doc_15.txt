Description:
Closes #2290
üìù Description
This PR fixes an issue where the closeOnSelect prop on DropdownItem was being overridden by the DropdownMenu settings, causing the dropdown to close even when closeOnSelect was set to false on an individual DropdownItem.
‚õ≥Ô∏è Current behavior (updates)
Currently, setting closeOnSelect to false on a DropdownItem does not prevent the dropdown from closing when that item is selected. This is because the onAction event handler on DropdownItem is deprecated and the closing behavior is controlled by the DropdownMenu settings.
üöÄ New behavior
The logic has been updated to respect the closeOnSelect prop on DropdownItem. Now, if closeOnSelect is set to false on a DropdownItem, selecting that item will not close the dropdown menu.
The relevant changes are:
+ const onAction = (key: Key) => {
+   if (closeOnSelect) {
+     onTopAction?.(key);
+   }
+ };
üí£ Is this a breaking change (Yes/No):
No

## Walkthrough

The update enhances the dropdown menu's functionality by ensuring that when the `closeOnSelect` property is set to false, the menu remains open after item selection. This is achieved by modifying the event handling in the `menu.tsx` file and introducing improved logic within the `useDropdown` hook, thereby providing a more predictable user experience.

<!--

```
packages/components/menu/src/menu.tsx: The `import` statement now includes the `Key` type from React. The `onAction` function has been renamed to `onTopAction`, and a new `onAction` function has been added to handle key actions, ensuring `onTopAction` is called if `closeOnSelect` is true.

---

.changeset/warm-planets-smile.md: The new file introduces a patch for the `@nextui-org/dropdown` package, specifically addressing an issue related to the `closeOnSelect` prop on `DropdownItem`.

---

packages/components/dropdown/__tests__/dropdown.test.tsx: A new test case titled "should respect closeOnSelect setting of DropdownItem" has been added to assess the functionality of the `closeOnSelect` property in the `DropdownItem` component. The test verifies that when `closeOnSelect` is set to `false`, the dropdown remains open after selecting the item, while it closes after selecting another item. The test enhances coverage for the Dropdown component by validating the behavior of the `closeOnSelect` property.

## Alterations to the declarations of exported or public entities

- No alterations to the declarations of exported or public entities were made in this diff.

---

packages/components/dropdown/src/use-dropdown.ts: The `useDropdown` function has undergone a significant modification in its `onAction` handler. The updated implementation introduces logic that identifies the item corresponding to the provided `key` and checks its `closeOnSelect` property. If `closeOnSelect` is `false`, it overrides the default behavior; otherwise, it defaults to using `props?.closeOnSelect`. This change allows for more nuanced handling of menu actions.

## Alterations to the declarations of exported or public entities

- `export function useDropdown(props: UseDropdownProps)` ‚Üí No changes to the function signature.

---

packages/components/dropdown/stories/dropdown.stories.tsx: A new template component, `ItemCloseOnSelectTemplate`, has been introduced, which renders a dropdown menu with two instances of dropdowns. The second dropdown includes the property `closeOnSelect={false}`, allowing it to remain open after item selection. A new export, `ItemCloseOnSelect`, is added, referencing the template and setting up default arguments for rendering.

## Alterations to the declarations of exported or public entities

- `export const ItemCloseOnSelect` ‚Üí `export const ItemCloseOnSelect = { render: ItemCloseOnSelectTemplate, args: { ...defaultProps } };`

## PR Summary

**Title:** fix(dropdown): respect closeOnSelect prop on DropdownItem(#2290)  
**User:** gtoxlili  
**Number:** 2598  

**Description:**  
This pull request addresses an issue where the `closeOnSelect` prop on `DropdownItem` was being overridden by the `DropdownMenu` settings, causing the dropdown to close even when `closeOnSelect` was set to `false` on an individual `DropdownItem`. The update ensures that if `closeOnSelect` is set to `false` on a `DropdownItem`, selecting that item will not close the dropdown menu. The relevant code changes include updating the `onAction` function to respect the `closeOnSelect` prop.

## Objectives from Linked Issues

**Issue #2290: Dropdown Unexpectedly Closes on Item Selection Despite closeOnSelect Being Set to False**

**Description:**
- **NextUI Version:** 2.2.9
- **Bug:** The `DropdownItem` component closes the dropdown menu upon item selection even when `closeOnSelect` is set to `false`.
- **Steps to Reproduce:**
  1. Create a `DropdownItem` component with multiple selectable items.
  2. Set the `closeOnSelect` property to `false` for a `DropdownItem`.
  3. Observe that the dropdown menu closes upon selection, contrary to the expected behavior.
- **Expected Behavior:** When `closeOnSelect` is set to `false`, selecting the item should not close the dropdown menu.
- **Operating System:** macOS (13.6.3)
- **Browser:** Edge

## Comments Summary

1. **gtoxlili:** Acknowledged the need for a changeset and provided before & after videos as requested.
2. **KoJem9Ka:** Expressed eagerness for the fix to be included in the release.
3. **gtoxlili:** Clarified the current behavior of the dropdown and added relevant templates for testing.
4. **wingkwong:** Requested the addition of tests in `/packages/components/dropdown/__tests__/dropdown.test.tsx`.
5. **gtoxlili:** Confirmed that the requested tests had been added.
6. **wingkwong:** Noted that some tests were failing and suggested syncing the branch with `canary`.
7. **gtoxlili:** After syncing with the `canary` branch and re-running tests, reported ongoing issues and requested further assistance.
8. **gtoxlili:** Identified and resolved issues with previous changes, uploaded an updated version, and conducted additional testing.
9. **gtoxlili:** Explained the root cause of the issue related to the coupling of `onAction` and `closeOnSelect` behaviors. The updated logic in the `onAction` function now checks if an item has `closeOnSelect` set to `false`, preventing the execution of the `onAction` from `DropdownMenu` in such cases.

I have already merged the canary branch into my fix branch and re-executed all the tests for the dropdown. These are the results on my local machine, and I still haven't found any errors. I don't have any clue how to solve this problem. If possible, perhaps you could provide me with some more detailed information?

![CleanShot 2024-05-06 at 18 34 49@2x](https://github.com/nextui-org/nextui/assets/39382699/262ca5f2-596c-4e3c-ba5a-d378a9d8701c)
\n- gtoxlili: The previous changes I proposed indeed had some issues. I have fixed them, uploaded the updated version, and conducted further testing. @wingkwong 
\n- gtoxlili: The main reason for the issue is that the component's previous design coupled the onAction and closeOnSelect behaviors.
```
const getMenuProps = <T>(
  props?: Partial<MenuProps<T>>,
  _ref: Ref<any> | null | undefined = null,
) => {
  return {
    ref: mergeRefs(_ref, menuRef),
    menuProps,
    closeOnSelect,
    ...mergeProps(props, {
      onAction: () => onMenuAction(props?.closeOnSelect),
      onClose: state.close,
    }),
  } as MenuProps;
};
```
In the previous design, the user-provided onAction was merged with the close event based on DropdownMenu's closeOnSelect using mergeProps. The merged onAction was then passed to the item. When the event was triggered, the item directly executed the onAction method passed from the menu. (This is also the reason why the closeOnSelect of the item component was ineffective.)

My previous modification did not consider the possibility of the user passing their own onAction. So, I chose to directly skip executing the onAction passed from DropdownMenu if the item had closeOnSelect. (I assumed mergeProps was an override-like setting, but it turned out to execute all events with the same name in sequence.)

Now, I have changed the close event to:
```
onAction: (key: any) => {
  // @ts-ignore
  const item = props?.children?.find((item) => item.key === key);

  if (item?.props?.closeOnSelect === false) {
    onMenuAction(false);

    return;
  }
  onMenuAction(props?.closeOnSelect);
}
```
Since the item passes its key when triggering onAction, I try to find whether it has closeOnSelect based on the key. I think this logic should be correct now (although the logic is still messy, mainly because this coupled design is not a good design).\n- jrgarciadev: Hey @gtoxlili please fix the conflicts\n- jrgarciadev: @gtoxlili sorry for the delay, please fix the conflicts\n
