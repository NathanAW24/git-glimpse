## Walkthrough
The changes in this pull request focus on the `toggle` component located in the `packages/core/theme/src/components/toggle.ts` file. The primary modification involves removing the `mr-2` and `me-2` classes from the `wrapper` styles for the `sm`, `md`, and `lg` size variants, which alters the margin-right and margin-end properties for these sizes. Additionally, the `label` style has been updated to include the `ms-2` class. The component's overall structure, functionality, and control flow remain unchanged, with adjustments made solely to the visual styling.

## Possibly related PRs
- **#3868**: This PR modifies the `toggle` component's exported types, which are also altered in the main PR, indicating a direct relationship in terms of changes made to the same component.
- **#3869**: Similar to the main PR, this PR addresses label placement in the `select` and `input` components, which may share styling considerations with the `toggle` component, particularly regarding the use of Tailwind CSS classes.

## Consolidated summary of changes

The diff updates the `toggle` component in the `packages/core/theme/src/components/toggle.ts` file, specifically altering the Tailwind CSS class definitions for the `wrapper` and `label` styles across different size variants. The `mr-2` and `me-2` classes have been removed from the `wrapper` styles for the `sm`, `md`, and `lg` size variants, which modifies the margin-right and margin-end properties for these sizes. Additionally, the `label` style has been updated to include the `ms-2` class, affecting its margin-start property. The overall structure of the component, including its slots, variants, and default variants, remains unchanged, preserving the functionality and control flow of the `toggle` component. Furthermore, a patch for the `@nextui-org/theme` package modifies the `Switch` component to show the margin only when a label is present, addressing issue number #3791 and enhancing the component's layout behavior in user interfaces.

## Alterations to the declarations of exported or public entities

- Type exported: `ToggleVariantProps` as `VariantProps<typeof toggle>` in `packages/core/theme/src/components/toggle.ts`
- Type exported: `ToggleSlots` as `keyof ReturnType<typeof toggle>` in `packages/core/theme/src/components/toggle.ts`
- Variable exported: `toggle` in `packages/core/theme/src/components/toggle.ts`

## PR Summary

The pull request titled "fix(switch): removed right margin in wrapper" was submitted by user ShrinidhiUpadhyaya and is identified by the number 3861. The primary objective of this PR is to address an issue related to the SWITCH component's width by removing an extra right margin from its wrapper. This change is intended to resolve the bug described in linked issue #3791, which reported that the SWITCH component had excessive width. The PR includes visual comparisons of the current behavior and the new behavior after the margin removal, illustrating the difference in appearance. The PR does not indicate whether this change is a breaking change. Additional information is not provided in the description.

## Objectives from Linked Issues

The linked issue #3791, titled "[BUG] - SWITCH Component Width Excessely," describes a bug affecting the SWITCH component in NextUI version 2.4.8. The issue highlights that the component has excessive width, which is visually represented in an attached screenshot. The user provided a code snippet demonstrating the SWITCH component's implementation, which includes properties such as `onClick`, `defaultSelected`, `size`, `color`, and content for both the start and end of the switch. The expected behavior outlined in the issue is that the SWITCH component should not exhibit excessive width. The issue can be reproduced using the provided code, and it has been reported to occur on both macOS and Windows operating systems, specifically in the Chrome browser. No additional examples or responses were provided by the user regarding their website or app.

## Comments Summary

In the comments on the PR, user macci001 requested that ShrinidhiUpadhyaya add a changeset for the modifications made in the pull request, suggesting the command `pnpm changeset` for this purpose. User wingkwong pointed out that there was a conflict that needed to be resolved and asked ShrinidhiUpadhyaya to re-request a review once the conflict was addressed. Wingkwong later commented that there was no change to review, to which ShrinidhiUpadhyaya responded by suggesting the closure of the PR, indicating that another PR (#3868) had similar changes for the fix.

Wingkwong then clarified that while PR #3868 had been merged into the canary branch, the issue could still be reproduced on that branch, providing a screenshot as evidence. ShrinidhiUpadhyaya acknowledged this and stated they would look into the matter further. The comments reflect a collaborative effort to address the issue, with requests for additional changes and clarifications regarding the status of the PR and related issues. ShrinidhiUpadhyaya also noted that the margin is not required when there is no label, suggesting that removing `me-2` would affect the Switch with a label. They proposed adding a left margin to the label instead, but wingkwong advised against using `ml` due to potential issues in RTL (right-to-left) layouts, recommending the use of `ms` instead.

### Chat

There are 3 ways to chat with [CodeRabbit](https://coderabbit.ai):

- Review comments: Directly reply to a review comment made by CodeRabbit. Example:
  - `I pushed a fix in commit <commit_id>, please review it.`
  - `Generate unit testing code for this file.`
  - `Open a follow-up GitHub issue for this discussion.`
- Files and specific lines of code (under the "Files changed" tab): Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new review comment at the desired location with your query. Examples:
  - `@coderabbitai generate unit testing code for this file.`
  -	`@coderabbitai modularize this function.`
- PR comments: Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new PR comment to ask questions about the PR branch. For the best results, please provide a very specific query, as very limited context is provided in this mode. Examples:
  - `@coderabbitai gather interesting stats about this repository and render them as a table. Additionally, render a pie chart showing the language distribution in the codebase.`
  - `@coderabbitai read src/utils.ts and generate unit testing code.`
  - `@coderabbitai read the files in the src/scheduler package and generate a class diagram using mermaid and a README in the markdown format.`
  - `@coderabbitai help me debug CodeRabbit configuration file.`

Note: Be mindful of the bot's finite context window. It's strongly recommended to break down tasks such as reading entire modules into smaller chunks. For a focused discussion, use review comments to chat about specific files and their changes, instead of using the PR comments.

Ohh okay, i missed reading that in the original issue. So can i just add left margin to the label `label: "relative text-foreground select-none ml-2",`. Is that fine?

**With Label:-**

\n- wingkwong: don't use `ml`. this would fail in RTL. use `ms` instead which covers RTL case.\n
