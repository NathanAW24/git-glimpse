Description:
The @nextui-org/theme module has several .mjs files that are not being read by tailwind.config.ts, which causes components to render without styling.
Updated the content array in tailwind.config.ts to include .mjs files:
'./node_modules/@nextui-org/theme/dist/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx,mjs}'
üìù Description
This pull request updates the tailwind.config.ts file to include .mjs files from the @nextui-org/theme module. This change ensures that TailwindCSS reads the module's .mjs files, which resolves the issue of components rendering without styling.
‚õ≥Ô∏è Current behavior (updates)
Currently, the tailwind.config.ts file does not include .mjs files in the content array. As a result, TailwindCSS does not read the styles from the @nextui-org/theme module, causing components to render without the correct styling.
üöÄ New behavior
With this update, the content array in tailwind.config.ts will include .mjs files. This change allows TailwindCSS to read the .mjs files from the @nextui-org/theme module, ensuring that components are styled correctly.
module.exports = {
  content: [
    './node_modules/@nextui-org/theme/dist/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx,mjs}',
    // other paths
  ],
  // other configurations
};
üí£ Is this a breaking change (Yes/No):
No.
üìù Additional Information
This change is backward compatible and does not affect existing functionality. It simply adds support for .mjs files in the TailwindCSS configuration, which is necessary for the proper styling of components from the @nextui-org/theme module.

## Walkthrough

The modification in the `installation.mdx` file within the `apps/docs/content/docs/guide` directory involves updating the file path pattern in the `content` array of the `module.exports` object. This change includes adding the `.mjs` file extension to the existing JavaScript and TypeScript file specifications in the `theme` module, enhancing compatibility with modern JavaScript module standards.

## PR summary

### Title
installation.mdx is incorrect

### Description
The pull request, submitted by the user davimarcilio, addresses an issue with the `@nextui-org/theme` module. The problem is that several `.mjs` files within this module are not being read by the `tailwind.config.ts` file, resulting in components rendering without styling.

To resolve this issue, the pull request updates the content array in the `tailwind.config.ts` file to include `.mjs` files. The specific change made is:

```js
'./node_modules/@nextui-org/theme/dist/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx,mjs}'
```

#### Current Behavior
Currently, the `tailwind.config.ts` file does not include `.mjs` files in the content array. This omission prevents TailwindCSS from reading the styles from the `@nextui-org/theme` module, leading to components rendering without the correct styling.

#### New Behavior
With this update, the content array in `tailwind.config.ts` will include `.mjs` files. This change allows TailwindCSS to read the `.mjs` files from the `@nextui-org/theme` module, ensuring that components are styled correctly.

```js
module.exports = {
  content: [
    './node_modules/@nextui-org/theme/dist/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx,mjs}',
    // other paths
  ],
  // other configurations
};
```

#### Breaking Change
This change is not a breaking change. It is backward compatible and does not affect existing functionality. It simply adds support for `.mjs` files in the TailwindCSS configuration, which is necessary for the proper styling of components from the `@nextui-org/theme` module.

<summary>Tips</summary>

### Chat

There are 3 ways to chat with [CodeRabbit](https://coderabbit.ai):

- Review comments: Directly reply to a review comment made by CodeRabbit. Example:
	- `I pushed a fix in commit <commit_id>.`
	- `Generate unit testing code for this file.`
	- `Open a follow-up GitHub issue for this discussion.`
- Files and specific lines of code (under the "Files changed" tab): Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new review comment at the desired location with your query. Examples:
	- `@coderabbitai generate unit testing code for this file.`
	-	`@coderabbitai modularize this function.`
- PR comments: Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new PR comment to ask questions about the PR branch. For the best results, please provide a very specific query, as very limited context is provided in this mode. Examples:
	- `@coderabbitai generate interesting stats about this repository and render them as a table.`
	- `@coderabbitai show all the console.log statements in this repository.`
	- `@coderabbitai read src/utils.ts and generate unit testing code.`
	- `@coderabbitai read the files in the src/scheduler package and generate a class diagram using mermaid and a README in the markdown format.`
	- `@coderabbitai help me debug CodeRabbit configuration file.`

Note: Be mindful of the bot's finite context window. It's strongly recommended to break down tasks such as reading entire modules into smaller chunks. For a focused discussion, use review comments to chat about specific files and their changes, instead of using the PR comments.

### CodeRabbit Commands (invoked as PR comments)

- `@coderabbitai pause` to pause the reviews on a PR.
- `@coderabbitai resume` to resume the paused reviews.
- `@coderabbitai review` to trigger an incremental review. This is useful when automatic reviews are disabled for the repository.
- `@coderabbitai full review` to do a full review from scratch and review all the files again.
- `@coderabbitai summary` to regenerate the summary of the PR.
- `@coderabbitai resolve` resolve all the CodeRabbit review comments.
- `@coderabbitai configuration` to show the current CodeRabbit configuration for the repository.
- `@coderabbitai help` to get help.


Additionally, you can add `@coderabbitai ignore` anywhere in the PR description to prevent this PR from being reviewed.

### CodeRabbit Configration File (`.coderabbit.yaml`)

- You can programmatically configure CodeRabbit by adding a `.coderabbit.yaml` file to the root of your repository.
- Please see the [configuration documentation](https://docs.coderabbit.ai/guides/configure-coderabbit) for more information.
