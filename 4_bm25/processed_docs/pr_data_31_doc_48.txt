Description, Motivation and Context
On the docs page, the "TableOfContent" component shows the list of headings and that's ok. But on the "Input" component page there are two "Input Types" heading and that causes the problem.
Steps to reproduce

Go Theme/Palette page
Go Input page
Go Theme/Palette page and you will see "Input Types" in the content list. If you repeat this circle it will add more "Input Types"
