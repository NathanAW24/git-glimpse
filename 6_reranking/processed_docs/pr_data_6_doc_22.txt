## Walkthrough

The documentation for the `Tabs` component has been updated to remove the `disallowEmptySelection` property. This change aligns the documentation with the current implementation of the component, simplifying the API by eliminating a property that no longer exists in the codebase. Other properties remain unchanged, ensuring that existing functionality is preserved.

apps/docs/content/docs/components/tabs.mdx: ## AI-generated summary of changes

The diff modifies the documentation for the `Tabs` component, specifically altering the properties listed in the component's API. The key change is the removal of the `disallowEmptySelection` property, which previously indicated whether the tabs should allow for an empty selection. This property had a default value of `false` and was described as controlling user interaction with the tabs. The removal suggests a shift in functionality, possibly indicating that empty selection is now allowed by default or that the feature has been deprecated. Other properties such as `shouldSelectOnPressUp`, `keyboardActivation`, and `motionProps` remain unchanged, maintaining their existing descriptions and types.

## PR Summary

The pull request titled "chore(docs): remove disallowEmptySelection from tabs page" was created by the user wingkwong and is numbered 3609. This PR addresses an inconsistency in the NextUI documentation regarding the `disallowEmptySelection` property for the Tabs component. It aims to remove references to this property from the documentation, as it does not actually exist in the Tabs implementation. The PR is linked to issue #3608, which reported the bug of the non-existent `disallowEmptySelection` prop being incorrectly documented. The request does not specify any new behavior or breaking changes, and it focuses solely on correcting the documentation.

## Objectives from Linked Issues

The linked issue #3608 describes a bug concerning the `disallowEmptySelection` property in the Tabs component of NextUI. The issue highlights that this property is mentioned in the documentation but does not exist in the actual codebase. The primary objective of the issue is to clarify this discrepancy by ensuring that the documentation accurately reflects the available properties for the Tabs component. The user who reported the issue provided details about the NextUI version (2.4.6) and confirmed that the problem can be reproduced by reviewing the documentation at the specified URL. The expected outcome is to eliminate any confusion regarding the `disallowEmptySelection` prop and to maintain the integrity of the documentation by removing any references to non-existent features.

### Chat

There are 3 ways to chat with [CodeRabbit](https://coderabbit.ai):

- Review comments: Directly reply to a review comment made by CodeRabbit. Example:
	- `I pushed a fix in commit <commit_id>.`
	- `Generate unit testing code for this file.`
	- `Open a follow-up GitHub issue for this discussion.`
- Files and specific lines of code (under the "Files changed" tab): Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new review comment at the desired location with your query. Examples:
	- `@coderabbitai generate unit testing code for this file.`
	-	`@coderabbitai modularize this function.`
- PR comments: Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new PR comment to ask questions about the PR branch. For the best results, please provide a very specific query, as very limited context is provided in this mode. Examples:
	- `@coderabbitai generate interesting stats about this repository and render them as a table.`
	- `@coderabbitai show all the console.log statements in this repository.`
	- `@coderabbitai read src/utils.ts and generate unit testing code.`
	- `@coderabbitai read the files in the src/scheduler package and generate a class diagram using mermaid and a README in the markdown format.`
	- `@coderabbitai help me debug CodeRabbit configuration file.`

Note: Be mindful of the bot's finite context window. It's strongly recommended to break down tasks such as reading entire modules into smaller chunks. For a focused discussion, use review comments to chat about specific files and their changes, instead of using the PR comments.

### CodeRabbit Commands (invoked as PR comments)

- `@coderabbitai pause` to pause the reviews on a PR.
- `@coderabbitai resume` to resume the paused reviews.
- `@coderabbitai review` to trigger an incremental review. This is useful when automatic reviews are disabled for the repository.
- `@coderabbitai full review` to do a full review from scratch and review all the files again.
- `@coderabbitai summary` to regenerate the summary of the PR.
- `@coderabbitai resolve` resolve all the CodeRabbit review comments.
- `@coderabbitai configuration` to show the current CodeRabbit configuration for the repository.
- `@coderabbitai help` to get help.


Additionally, you can add `@coderabbitai ignore` anywhere in the PR description to prevent this PR from being reviewed.

### CodeRabbit Configuration File (`.coderabbit.yaml`)

- You can programmatically configure CodeRabbit by adding a `.coderabbit.yaml` file to the root of your repository.
- Please see the [configuration documentation](https://docs.coderabbit.ai/guides/configure-coderabbit) for more information.
- If your editor has YAML language server enabled, you can add the path at the top of this file to enable auto-completion and validation: `# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://coderabbit.ai/integrations/schema.v2.json`
