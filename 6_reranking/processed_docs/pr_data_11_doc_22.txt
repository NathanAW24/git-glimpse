## Walkthrough
The update involves renaming and changing the file extension of the primary component in the `time-zones.ts` file. Specifically, `DatePicker` is now imported from a different source, and the component file has transitioned from TypeScript (`tsx`) to JavaScript (`jsx`). Additionally, the component's reference name in the application has been simplified.

## Changes

| File Path                  | Change Summary                                      |
|----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| `.../components/.../time-zones.ts` | Renamed `DatePicker`, updated file extension to `.jsx`, and simplified component reference name. |

apps/docs/content/components/date-picker/time-zones.ts: ## Short Summary

The change in functionality involves renaming the imported component `DatePicker` in the `App` function from `@nextui-org/react` and updating the file extension from `.tsx` to `.jsx`.

## Alterations to the declarations of exported or public entities

- `const AppTs` in `time-zones.ts` => `const App` in `time-zones.ts`
- `"/App.tsx": AppTs` in `time-zones.ts` => `"/App.jsx": App` in `time-zones.ts`

### PR Objectives (User Provided Facts)

The pull request (PR) number 2919, titled "docs(date-picker): change to jsx instead," aims to address an issue documented in issue #2918. The issue reported is a discrepancy in the displayed code for the DatePicker component's time zone feature on the NextUI documentation website. Specifically, the code snippet intended to demonstrate handling time zones incorrectly shows a "Hello World" example instead of the relevant code.

The PR proposes changes to the documentation of the DatePicker component by switching the code examples from TypeScript (`.tsx`) to JavaScript (`.jsx`). This alteration is part of the documentation category of PRs, which focuses on improving the clarity and accuracy of the documentation provided to the users of the NextUI library.

The PR description includes a placeholder for a brief description of the changes, the current behavior being modified, and the new behavior introduced by the PR. It also contains an image link, presumably showing the updated component or documentation, though the image is not directly viewable from the text provided.

Additionally, the PR mentions that it does not introduce breaking changes, which implies that existing users of the NextUI library will not need to alter their implementations as a result of these changes.

### AI-Generated Summary of Generated Summaries

The pull request involves modifications to the `time-zones.ts` file within the NextUI documentation. The primary change is the renaming of the `DatePicker` component's import in the `App` function from the `@nextui-org/react` package. Additionally, the file extension of the component used in the example is updated from `.tsx` (TypeScript) to `.jsx` (JavaScript). This change aligns with the PR's objective to switch the code examples from TypeScript to JavaScript, thereby potentially making them more accessible or consistent with other parts of the documentation.

### Alterations to the Declarations of Exported or Public Entities

- **Before Changes:**
  - `const AppTs` in `time-zones.ts`
  - `"/App.tsx": AppTs` in `time-zones.ts`

- **After Changes:**
  - `const App` in `time-zones.ts`
  - `"/App.jsx": App` in `time-zones.ts`

These alterations indicate a simplification in the naming convention (removing the 'Ts' suffix) and a change in the file extension from TypeScript to JavaScript, reflecting the broader shift in the documentation approach as described in the PR.

### Chat

There are 3 ways to chat with [CodeRabbit](https://coderabbit.ai):

- Review comments: Directly reply to a review comment made by CodeRabbit. Example:
	- `I pushed a fix in commit <commit_id>.`
	- `Generate unit testing code for this file.`
	- `Open a follow-up GitHub issue for this discussion.`
- Files and specific lines of code (under the "Files changed" tab): Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new review comment at the desired location with your query. Examples:
	- `@coderabbitai generate unit testing code for this file.`
	-	`@coderabbitai modularize this function.`
- PR comments: Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new PR comment to ask questions about the PR branch. For the best results, please provide a very specific query, as very limited context is provided in this mode. Examples:
	- `@coderabbitai generate interesting stats about this repository and render them as a table.`
	- `@coderabbitai show all the console.log statements in this repository.`
	- `@coderabbitai read src/utils.ts and generate unit testing code.`
	- `@coderabbitai read the files in the src/scheduler package and generate a class diagram using mermaid and a README in the markdown format.`

Note: Be mindful of the bot's finite context window. It's strongly recommended to break down tasks such as reading entire modules into smaller chunks. For a focused discussion, use review comments to chat about specific files and their changes, instead of using the PR comments.

### CodeRabbit Commands (invoked as PR comments)

- `@coderabbitai pause` to pause the reviews on a PR.
- `@coderabbitai resume` to resume the paused reviews.
- `@coderabbitai review` to trigger a review. This is useful when automatic reviews are disabled for the repository.
- `@coderabbitai resolve` resolve all the CodeRabbit review comments.
- `@coderabbitai help` to get help.


Additionally, you can add `@coderabbitai ignore` anywhere in the PR description to prevent this PR from being reviewed.

### CodeRabbit Configration File (`.coderabbit.yaml`)

- You can programmatically configure CodeRabbit by adding a `.coderabbit.yaml` file to the root of your repository.
- Please see the [configuration documentation](https://docs.coderabbit.ai/guides/configure-coderabbit) for more information.
- If your editor has YAML language server enabled, you can add the path at the top of this file to enable auto-completion and validation: `# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://coderabbit.ai/integrations/schema.v2.json`
