## Walkthrough
The update modifies the `@nextui-org/use-aria-accordion` package, specifically addressing a bug where the ctrl+a shortcut did not function correctly inside an Accordion component set to `selectionMode="multiple"`. The patch introduces a `disallowSelectAll: true` property to prevent unwanted select-all behavior, ensuring that text within nested input fields can be selected as intended.

## Changes

| Fix ctrl-a / cmd-a not working in Input inside Accordion (#2055)          | ‚úÖ         |             |
| Ensure ctrl-a / cmd-a works when `selectionMode="multiple"` is set (#2055)| ‚úÖ         |             |

### PR Objectives (User Provided Facts)

The pull request (PR) number 2063 titled "fix(accordion): ctrl+a shortcut inside" aims to resolve an issue where the ctrl+a (select all) keyboard shortcut does not function within input elements inside an Accordion component when it is set to `selectionMode="multiple"`. This issue is documented in GitHub issue #2055.

The PR introduces a change to the `useSelectableList` hook from `react-aria`, specifically by setting the `disallowSelectAll: true` property. This modification ensures that when users focus on an Input or TextArea element inside an Accordion with `selectionMode="multiple"`, they can use the ctrl+a shortcut to select all the content inside the input box. The current behavior, as reported, is that the shortcut has no effect under these conditions.

The submitter of the PR has indicated that this is their first contribution and has requested feedback if there are any issues with the PR. The change is not expected to be a breaking change for existing users of the NextUI library.

### Comments Summary

The comments on the PR are minimal but positive. A user named `jrgarciadev` has thanked the contributor (`@black197`) for the PR, indicating approval or appreciation for the work done. This suggests that the PR is well-received by at least one other developer, although it does not provide substantive feedback on the technical aspects of the changes.

### AI-Generated Summary of Generated Summaries

The PR introduces a patch to the `use-aria-accordion` hook within the NextUI library's accordion component. The key change involves adding the `disallowSelectAll: true` property to the configuration of the `useReactAriaAccordion` function. This adjustment specifically targets and rectifies the issue where the ctrl+a shortcut failed to select all text in input fields within accordions set to `selectionMode="multiple"`. This change ensures that the shortcut now functions as expected, allowing for text selection across different operating systems and browsers.

### Chat

There are 3 ways to chat with [CodeRabbit](https://coderabbit.ai):

- Review comments: Directly reply to a review comment made by CodeRabbit. Example:
	- `I pushed a fix in commit <commit_id>.`
	- `Generate unit testing code for this file.`
	- `Open a follow-up GitHub issue for this discussion.`
- Files and specific lines of code (under the "Files changed" tab): Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new review comment at the desired location with your query. Examples:
	- `@coderabbitai generate unit testing code for this file.`
	-	`@coderabbitai modularize this function.`
- PR comments: Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new PR comment to ask questions about the PR branch. For the best results, please provide a very specific query, as very limited context is provided in this mode. Examples:
	- `@coderabbitai generate interesting stats about this repository and render them as a table.`
	- `@coderabbitai show all the console.log statements in this repository.`
	- `@coderabbitai read src/utils.ts and generate unit testing code.`
	- `@coderabbitai read the files in the src/scheduler package and generate a class diagram using mermaid and a README in the markdown format.`

Note: Be mindful of the bot's finite context window. It's strongly recommended to break down tasks such as reading entire modules into smaller chunks. For a focused discussion, use review comments to chat about specific files and their changes, instead of using the PR comments.

### CodeRabbit Commands (invoked as PR comments)

- `@coderabbitai pause` to pause the reviews on a PR.
- `@coderabbitai resume` to resume the paused reviews.
- `@coderabbitai review` to trigger a review. This is useful when automatic reviews are disabled for the repository.
- `@coderabbitai resolve` resolve all the CodeRabbit review comments.
- `@coderabbitai help` to get help.


Additionally, you can add `@coderabbitai ignore` anywhere in the PR description to prevent this PR from being reviewed.
