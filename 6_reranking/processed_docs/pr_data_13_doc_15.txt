## Walkthrough

The recent updates focus on enhancing component documentation and customization. The `ComponentLinks` component now supports optional `npm` and `source` links, improving resource accessibility. Additionally, the `input` component documentation has been revised for better clarity in customizing class names, and specific references have been added in the `scroll-shadow` documentation for improved navigation.

### PR Objectives

The pull request titled "fix: correct links in docs" with number 2708 aims to address issues with broken links and a typo in the documentation. The changes are confined to documentation updates, ensuring that the scope of the PR remains narrow and focused. The description indicates that a specific link was broken and has now been fixed, alongside a correction to a typo. Although the PR description template includes sections for describing current and new behaviors, these sections are not filled out, which is typical for documentation changes where the behavior of the software remains unchanged. The PR does not specify which GitHub issue it closes, as the placeholder in the template remains uncommented.

### AI-Generated Summary of Generated Summaries

The pull request introduces several updates to the documentation components in the project. Specifically, it enhances the `ComponentLinks` component by adding optional `npm` and `source` properties to its props interface. These additions allow for conditional rendering of links based on the presence of these properties. This update is applied across various documentation files, including those for the `radio-group` and `scroll-shadow` components, where the `ComponentLinks` component is used to link to additional resources like NPM or source code.

Additionally, there is an update in the `input.mdx` file where the `classNames` property for the input component has been corrected to apply to input slots instead of checkbox slots, fixing a previous misconfiguration. This change ensures that custom class names are appropriately applied to the correct component parts, enhancing the flexibility and usability of the input component documentation.

`11-12`: Added optional `npm` and `source` properties to `ComponentLinksProps`. Ensure these properties are documented and their usage is clear to other developers.

---

`65-66`: The `npm` and `source` properties are now used in the `ComponentLinks` rendering logic. This is a good use of optional chaining to provide fallbacks. Ensure that the fallbacks (`component` name) are appropriate in all use cases.

---

`87-90`: The NPM link now dynamically uses the `npm` property if available. This change enhances the flexibility of the component. Ensure that all NPM package names follow the format `@nextui-org/{name}`.

---

`120-123`: The source link now dynamically uses the `source` property if available. This change allows for more accurate linking to the source code. Verify that the `COMPONENT_PATH` constant correctly points to the GitHub repository path.

<details>
<summary>Verification successful</summary>



---

The `COMPONENT_PATH` constant is defined to point to different paths based on the `__PREVIEW__` condition. If `__PREVIEW__` is true, it points to the `feat/v2` branch under `packages/components`. Otherwise, it points to the `main` branch under `packages/components`. Both paths are correctly constructed to link to the GitHub repository `nextui-org/nextui`.

This setup allows the source link in the `ButtonLink` component to dynamically use the `source` property if available, and correctly formulates the URL to the GitHub repository, ensuring accurate linking to the source code of the components.

Based on this information, the review comment is verified as the `COMPONENT_PATH` correctly points to the GitHub repository path, and the dynamic use of the `source` property is appropriately implemented.

<summary>Tips</summary>

### Chat

There are 3 ways to chat with [CodeRabbit](https://coderabbit.ai):

- Review comments: Directly reply to a review comment made by CodeRabbit. Example:
	- `I pushed a fix in commit <commit_id>.`
	- `Generate unit testing code for this file.`
	- `Open a follow-up GitHub issue for this discussion.`
- Files and specific lines of code (under the "Files changed" tab): Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new review comment at the desired location with your query. Examples:
	- `@coderabbitai generate unit testing code for this file.`
	-	`@coderabbitai modularize this function.`
- PR comments: Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new PR comment to ask questions about the PR branch. For the best results, please provide a very specific query, as very limited context is provided in this mode. Examples:
	- `@coderabbitai generate interesting stats about this repository and render them as a table.`
	- `@coderabbitai show all the console.log statements in this repository.`
	- `@coderabbitai read src/utils.ts and generate unit testing code.`
	- `@coderabbitai read the files in the src/scheduler package and generate a class diagram using mermaid and a README in the markdown format.`

Note: Be mindful of the bot's finite context window. It's strongly recommended to break down tasks such as reading entire modules into smaller chunks. For a focused discussion, use review comments to chat about specific files and their changes, instead of using the PR comments.

### CodeRabbit Commands (invoked as PR comments)

- `@coderabbitai pause` to pause the reviews on a PR.
- `@coderabbitai resume` to resume the paused reviews.
- `@coderabbitai review` to trigger a review. This is useful when automatic reviews are disabled for the repository.
- `@coderabbitai resolve` resolve all the CodeRabbit review comments.
- `@coderabbitai help` to get help.


Additionally, you can add `@coderabbitai ignore` anywhere in the PR description to prevent this PR from being reviewed.

### CodeRabbit Configration File (`.coderabbit.yaml`)

- You can programmatically configure CodeRabbit by adding a `.coderabbit.yaml` file to the root of your repository.
- Please see the [configuration documentation](https://docs.coderabbit.ai/guides/configure-coderabbit) for more information.
- If your editor has YAML language server enabled, you can add the path at the top of this file to enable auto-completion and validation: `# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://coderabbit.ai/integrations/schema.v2.json`
