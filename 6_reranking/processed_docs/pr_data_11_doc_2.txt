## Walkthrough
The update introduces a CSS change in the `@nextui-org/theme` package to address an issue where the focus outline of a button placed within a Skeleton component was hidden due to `overflow-hidden`. The patch changes the overflow property to visible once the Skeleton is loaded, ensuring visibility of outlines and other overflow content.

These changes directly address the issue of hidden outlines by modifying the overflow property, ensuring that the focus outline of buttons and potentially other elements within the Skeleton component becomes visible upon loading.

### PR Summary

**Title:** fix(skeleton): overflow issue in skeleton  
**PR Number:** 2986  

**Description:**  
This pull request addresses an issue identified in issue #2125, where the focus outline of a button placed within a Skeleton component becomes invisible. The root cause of this problem is attributed to the `overflow-hidden` property applied to the Skeleton component. The proposed fix involves modifying this property to ensure that the focus outline remains visible when elements within the Skeleton are focused.

**Visual Changes:**  
The PR includes before and after screenshots to visually demonstrate the problem and the effect of the proposed fix:
- **Current Behavior:** A screenshot shows the button inside the Skeleton without a visible focus outline.
- **New Behavior:** A screenshot post-fix shows the button with a visible focus outline.

**Impact:**  
The description does not explicitly state whether this change is a breaking change. It focuses solely on resolving the visibility issue of the focus outline without indicating any broader impacts on existing users of the NextUI library.

**Linked Issue:**  
### #2125: [BUG] - Outline hidden in skeleton  
- **Description:** Users experience an issue where the focus outline of a button embedded in a Skeleton component is not visible. This is due to the `overflow-hidden` CSS property of the Skeleton.
- **Steps to Reproduce:** The issue can be reproduced by placing a button inside a Skeleton component and attempting to focus on the button.
- **Expected Behavior:** The expected behavior is for the focus outline of the button to be visible when it is focused.
- **Screenshots:** The issue is illustrated with a screenshot showing the button without a visible focus outline due to the `overflow-hidden` property.

This pull request aims to resolve the visibility issue of the focus outline by adjusting the CSS properties of the Skeleton component, thereby enhancing the accessibility and user interaction within the NextUI framework.

### AI-generated Summary of Generated Summaries

A new update has been implemented in the `@nextui-org/theme` package, specifically within the `skeleton` component located at `packages/core/theme/src/components/skeleton.ts`. This update introduces a CSS class selector `data-[loaded=true]:overflow-visible` which is activated once the skeleton component has fully loaded. This change is designed to address issue #2125 by setting the overflow property to visible, ensuring that content does not get clipped or hidden post-loading.

### Alterations to the Declarations of Exported or Public Entities

**File: `packages/core/theme/src/components/skeleton.ts`**

**Before Changes:**
- `const skeleton`: No specific mention of handling the `overflow` property based on the component's loaded state.

**After Changes:**

### Chat

There are 3 ways to chat with [CodeRabbit](https://coderabbit.ai):

- Review comments: Directly reply to a review comment made by CodeRabbit. Example:
	- `I pushed a fix in commit <commit_id>.`
	- `Generate unit testing code for this file.`
	- `Open a follow-up GitHub issue for this discussion.`
- Files and specific lines of code (under the "Files changed" tab): Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new review comment at the desired location with your query. Examples:
	- `@coderabbitai generate unit testing code for this file.`
	-	`@coderabbitai modularize this function.`
- PR comments: Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new PR comment to ask questions about the PR branch. For the best results, please provide a very specific query, as very limited context is provided in this mode. Examples:
	- `@coderabbitai generate interesting stats about this repository and render them as a table.`
	- `@coderabbitai show all the console.log statements in this repository.`
	- `@coderabbitai read src/utils.ts and generate unit testing code.`
	- `@coderabbitai read the files in the src/scheduler package and generate a class diagram using mermaid and a README in the markdown format.`

Note: Be mindful of the bot's finite context window. It's strongly recommended to break down tasks such as reading entire modules into smaller chunks. For a focused discussion, use review comments to chat about specific files and their changes, instead of using the PR comments.

### CodeRabbit Commands (invoked as PR comments)

- `@coderabbitai pause` to pause the reviews on a PR.
- `@coderabbitai resume` to resume the paused reviews.
- `@coderabbitai review` to trigger a review. This is useful when automatic reviews are disabled for the repository.
- `@coderabbitai resolve` resolve all the CodeRabbit review comments.
- `@coderabbitai help` to get help.


Additionally, you can add `@coderabbitai ignore` anywhere in the PR description to prevent this PR from being reviewed.

### CodeRabbit Configration File (`.coderabbit.yaml`)

- You can programmatically configure CodeRabbit by adding a `.coderabbit.yaml` file to the root of your repository.
- Please see the [configuration documentation](https://docs.coderabbit.ai/guides/configure-coderabbit) for more information.
- If your editor has YAML language server enabled, you can add the path at the top of this file to enable auto-completion and validation: `# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://coderabbit.ai/integrations/schema.v2.json`
