Description:
Closes #2470
üìù Description
This change ensures that emptyContent is hidden if isLoading is true
‚õ≥Ô∏è Current behavior (updates)
Currently, if loadingContent and emptyContent are both provided, and isLoading is true, NextUI will render both of them on top of each other.
üöÄ New behavior
This change suppresses the rendering of emptyContent if isLoading is true.
üí£ Is this a breaking change (Yes/No):
No.
üìù Additional Information
Note that there's an existing issue with loadingContent where if emptyContent is not provided, NextUI will render loadingContent on top of the columns (instead of inside the table). This change doesn't fix that, but rather make isLoading/loadingContent play nice with a provided emptyContent. A separate fix is still needed for when emptyContent is not provided.

Avoid displaying loadingContent and emptyContent at the same time.
Note that there's an existing issue with loadingContent where if
emptyContent is not provided, it will render loadingContent on top of
the columns (instead of inside the table). This change doesn't fix that,
but rather make isLoading play nice with a provided emptyContent. A
separate fix is still needed for when emptyContent is not provided, which
may affect this change later.\n

A member of the Team first needs to [authorize it](https://vercel.com/git/authorize?team=NextUI%20Inc&type=github&job=%7B%22headInfo%22%3A%7B%22sha%22%3A%22ad15d0573945000a57a482bdcf16174cf6dfd36a%22%7D%2C%22id%22%3A%22QmTjRoNhWcwWQLFEBjw31X17cV8AqQj48B9eZhRUTuSfMx%22%2C%22org%22%3A%22nextui-org%22%2C%22prId%22%3A2491%2C%22repo%22%3A%22nextui%22%7D).

\n- brunokc: Hi @jrgarciadev @tianenpang @wingkwong,

This change seems to be enough for `isLoading` and `emptyContent` to play nice in my scenario, where both are supplied. However, I had to change my original fix so that `loadingContent` renders in the right place (inside the table instead of on top of the columns), but that only works if `emptyContent` is provided. 

I'm not sure this is acceptable. I intended to fix the "`loadingContent` without `emptyContent`" rendering issue but I don't know enough about the framework to propose a fix. I'd be happy to follow your guidance and try to fix it, if you have any suggestions.\n- alphaxek: > Hi @jrgarciadev @tianenpang @wingkwong,
