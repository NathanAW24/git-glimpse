## Walkthrough
The changes in this pull request involve the addition of a `key` prop to the `SelectItem` components within the `Select` component in the `App` function. This modification ensures that each `SelectItem` has a unique key based on the corresponding animal object's `key` property, which is essential for React's reconciliation process. The overall functionality of the `App` component remains unchanged.

## AI-generated summary of changes

The diff introduces a modification in the rendering of `SelectItem` components within the `Select` component in the `App` function. Specifically, the change involves the addition of a `key` prop to the `SelectItem` component. The original line of code, which rendered the `SelectItem` without a key, has been updated to include `key={animal.key}`. This adjustment ensures that each `SelectItem` has a unique key based on the `key` property of the corresponding animal object, which is important for React's reconciliation process.

The overall structure and functionality of the `App` component remain unchanged, with the `Select` component still receiving the `animals` array as its items and maintaining the same label and placeholder attributes.



## Alterations to the declarations of exported or public entities

## PR Summary

The pull request titled "Update dynamic.ts with missing key prop" was submitted by user lucasromerodb and is identified as PR number 3890 on GitHub. This PR addresses an issue related to the NextUI documentation, specifically the missing key attribute in a code example for the Select component. The change is intended to fix the documentation by adding the key prop to the SelectItem component within the dynamic.ts file. The specific code modification involves adding `key={animal.key}` to the SelectItem, which is crucial for React's reconciliation process when rendering lists of components. This update is linked to issue #3888, which highlights the same problem in the documentation. The PR aims to enhance the clarity and functionality of the documentation by ensuring that the provided code example adheres to best practices in React development.

## Objectives from Linked Issues

The linked issue #3888, titled "[BUG] - Select: missing key attribute in the code example," outlines a bug in the NextUI documentation for version 2.4.2. The issue describes the absence of a key attribute in the code example for the Select component, which is essential for React to efficiently manage lists of elements. The current example provided in the documentation does not include the key prop, leading to potential rendering issues. The expected behavior, as detailed in the issue, is to include the key attribute in the SelectItem component, specifically as `key={animal.key}`. This change is necessary to ensure that the Select component functions correctly when rendering dynamic items. The issue includes a screenshot illustrating the problem and emphasizes the need for this fix to improve the documentation's accuracy and usability.

`28-28`: **Excellent addition of the `key` prop!**

This change correctly addresses the issue reported in #3888 by adding the missing `key` prop to the `SelectItem` component. Using `animal.key` as the key value is appropriate, as it provides a unique identifier for each item in the list.

This modification is crucial for two reasons:
1. It adheres to React best practices for rendering lists of elements.
2. It improves the accuracy and quality of the NextUI documentation.

Great job on enhancing the code example!

### Chat

There are 3 ways to chat with [CodeRabbit](https://coderabbit.ai):

- Review comments: Directly reply to a review comment made by CodeRabbit. Example:
  - `I pushed a fix in commit <commit_id>, please review it.`
  - `Generate unit testing code for this file.`
  - `Open a follow-up GitHub issue for this discussion.`
- Files and specific lines of code (under the "Files changed" tab): Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new review comment at the desired location with your query. Examples:
  - `@coderabbitai generate unit testing code for this file.`
  -	`@coderabbitai modularize this function.`
- PR comments: Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new PR comment to ask questions about the PR branch. For the best results, please provide a very specific query, as very limited context is provided in this mode. Examples:
  - `@coderabbitai gather interesting stats about this repository and render them as a table. Additionally, render a pie chart showing the language distribution in the codebase.`
  - `@coderabbitai read src/utils.ts and generate unit testing code.`
  - `@coderabbitai read the files in the src/scheduler package and generate a class diagram using mermaid and a README in the markdown format.`
  - `@coderabbitai help me debug CodeRabbit configuration file.`

Note: Be mindful of the bot's finite context window. It's strongly recommended to break down tasks such as reading entire modules into smaller chunks. For a focused discussion, use review comments to chat about specific files and their changes, instead of using the PR comments.
