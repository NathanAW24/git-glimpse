Investigation / Analysis\n* Contextual Review: The issue involves checkboxes in a multi-selection table component not selecting the corresponding rows, while other areas of the row are functioning correctly for selection purposes. This inconsistency can frustrate users and hinder usability.\n* Inspection of Existing Code and Behavior: Review the logic in `table.tsx`, which is responsible for managing the selection behavior of table rows, and `checkbox.tsx`, which handles the rendering of checkboxes. Pay close attention to any event listeners that might be misconfigured or not correctly propagating selection events.\n* Relevant Files (to look at)\n    * `checkbox.tsx`: Handles rendering of checkboxes.\n    * `table.tsx`: Manages table logic, including row selection.\n    * `use-checkbox.ts`: Defines the checkbox component\u2019s internal logic.\n* Error and Performance Analysis: The root cause may stem from how event handling is structured in the checkbox component.

    "reference_answer": "### General Answer Structure\n\n#### 1. Investigation / Analysis\n**Contextual Review:**  \nThe issue arises because the `helper-wrapper` div is being rendered unnecessarily when `isInvalid` is `false` but either `errorMessage` or `description` is present. This causes layout shifts, leading to a sliding problem in the UI.\n\n**Inspection of Existing Code and Behavior:**  \n- Current behavior: The `helper-wrapper` div is always created based on partial validation conditions, which results in unnecessary rendering.  \n- Affected components: `Input`, `Textarea`, and `Select`.\n\n**Relevant Files (to look at):**\n- `packages/components/input/src/input.tsx`: Contains logic for rendering helper wrappers in the Input component.  \n- `packages/components/input/src/textarea.tsx`: Manages the rendering logic for helper text in the Textarea component.  \n- `packages/components/select/src/select.tsx`: Handles the helper wrapper logic for the Select component.  \n\n**Error Analysis:**  \nThe issue stems from incomplete conditional logic for rendering helper wrappers. The helper wrapper is being rendered even when `isInvalid` is `false`, which leads to layout instability and unintended sliding effects in the UI.\n\n---\n\n#### 2. Proposed Solution / Implementation Steps\n**Files to create or add:**  \nNo new files are required.\n\n**High-Level Changes:**  \nRefactor the conditional rendering logic for helper wrappers to ensure that they are only rendered when necessary, i.e., when `isInvalid` is `true` or when `errorMessage` or `description` is provided.\n\n**Specific Technical Steps:**  \n1. **Update Conditional Rendering Logic:**  \n   - Modify the conditional checks in `input.tsx`, `textarea.tsx`, and `select.tsx` to include all relevant conditions (`isInvalid`, `errorMessage`, and `description`).  \n   - Ensure that the `helper-wrapper` div is not rendered if all these conditions are `false`.\n\n2. **Adjust JSX Structure:**  \n   - Update the JSX to simplify the rendering logic for helper text and wrappers in the affected files.\n\n3. **Refactor Props and Type Definitions:**  \n   - Update the `InputProps` and `SelectProps` type definitions to reflect the refined conditional logic and ensure better clarity for developers.\n\n4. **Enhance Code Readability:**  \n   - Refactor the helper-rendering logic into reusable functions or constants for better maintainability.\n\n---\n\n#### 3. Post-Fix / Post-Implementation Checks\n**Testing and Verification:**  \n- **Unit Tests:**  \n   - Add or update unit tests to validate that the `helper-wrapper` div renders only when necessary.  \n   - Test for various combinations of `isInvalid`, `errorMessage`, and `description` to ensure coverage of edge cases.  \n\n- **User Interaction Tests:**  \n   - Verify that the sliding issue is resolved and that there are no unintended layout shifts.\n\n- **Performance and Reliability:**  \n   - Confirm that rendering optimizations improve visual stability without introducing new issues.\n\n---\n\n#### 4. Documentation and Communication\n**Update Documentation:**  \n- Add clear examples in the documentation showing the expected behavior of the `helper-wrapper` div based on different prop combinations.\n\n**Add Release Notes:**  \n- Include an entry in the project\u2019s CHANGELOG highlighting:  \n   - The bug fix for the `helper-wrapper` rendering issue.  \n   - The improvement in visual stability for `Input`, `Textarea`, and `Select` components.  \n\n**Developer Communication:**  \n- Inform team members about the changes during the next sprint meeting or via internal communication channels.",

    "predicted_answer": "1. Investigation / Analysis\n* Contextual Review: The current implementation of the Popover component in the NextUI library does not allow for customization of its behavior when the user scrolls. This may lead to the popover closing unexpectedly during user interactions, which is not desirable in all use cases.\n* Inspection of Existing Code and Behavior: The Popover component is primarily managed in `popover.tsx` where it handles visibility and events.
