## Walkthrough
The recent updates involve modifying configuration settings and restructuring exports across several packages. Changes include adding JavaScript banners, reorganizing exports for clarity, and updating comments. These adjustments aim to enhance module accessibility and maintain compatibility with build tools and environments.

| #2735: Ensure Spinner works with SSR | ‚ùì         | The changes address the export issue, but it's unclear if this resolves the SSR compatibility.   |

The assessment indicates that the export issue reported in #2735 has been addressed by restructuring exports to named exports instead of using "export *". However, it's still uncertain if these changes alone ensure that the Spinner component works correctly with server-side rendering (SSR) without further testing or confirmation.

<!-- walkthrough_end --><!-- This is an auto-generated comment: raw summary by coderabbit.ai -->
<!--


.packages/core/react/src/index.ts: The change in functionality involves updating a comment related to a development directive in the code.

---

.packages/core/react/tsup.config.ts: Added a `banner` property to the configuration object with a JavaScript banner specifying `"use client";`.

---

.packages/core/system-rsc/src/index.ts: The functionality change involves restructuring the exports in the `index.ts` file to export specific types individually and reorganize the exports of utility functions and variants extension. This change aims to provide clearer and more granular access to types and functions within the module.

---

.packages/core/system/tsup.config.ts: This new file, `tsup.config.ts`, introduces configuration settings for the `tsup` build tool. It specifies options for cleaning output, setting the target environment to ES2019, defining output formats as CommonJS and ECMAScript modules, and adding a banner to the generated JavaScript files.

---

.packages/utilities/react-rsc-utils/src/index.ts: The functionality change involves restructuring the exports in the `react-rsc-utils` package, specifically modifying the exported entities to be more explicit and organized, focusing on individual exports for better clarity and maintainability.

### PR Objectives (User Provided Facts)

The pull request (PR) number 2758 titled "fix(core): named exports and client directive" aims to address an issue documented in issue #2735. The problem described in the issue involves a build failure in NextJS 14.2.1 when using the Spinner component from the `@nextui-org/react` package. The error message indicates that the use of "export *" is unsupported in a client boundary, suggesting a need for named exports instead.

The PR makes several changes across multiple packages within a project, likely a library or framework, to resolve this issue and possibly enhance the system's overall modularity and compliance with newer JavaScript standards. The changes include modifications to export statements and configurations in various TypeScript and JavaScript files.

The main goal of the PR is to refactor the way modules and components are exported across the system, moving away from aggregated exports to more explicit, named exports. This change not only addresses the immediate compatibility issue with NextJS but also improves the clarity and maintainability of the codebase. Additionally, the PR introduces a specific client directive in some configuration files, which might be related to optimizing the library for client-side operations.

### AI-Generated Summary of Generated Summaries

The pull request introduces several key changes across different packages aimed at enhancing module export patterns and build configurations. Specifically, the changes include:

1. **Refactoring of Export Statements**: Several files, such as `.packages/core/system-rsc/src/index.ts` and `.packages/utilities/react-rsc-utils/src/index.ts`, have been updated to use named exports instead of aggregated exports. This modification not only resolves the issue with the NextJS build (as described in issue #2735) but also improves the granularity and clarity of the module exports.

2. **Configuration Adjustments**: New configuration files like `.packages/core/system/tsup.config.ts` and modifications to existing ones such as `.packages/core/react/tsup.config.ts` have been made. These changes involve setting up new build configurations using the `tsup` tool, specifying target environments, output formats, and adding specific JavaScript banners. A notable addition is the `"use client";` directive in the banner, which might be aimed at optimizing the library for client-side usage.

These changes collectively enhance the library's compatibility with modern development environments like NextJS, improve the maintainability of the code by using clearer export structures, and optimize the build process for client-side operations.

<details><summary>Additional comments not posted (5)</summary><blockquote>
<details><summary>packages/core/system/tsup.config.ts (1)</summary><blockquote>

`3-8`: The configuration settings for `tsup` are well-defined and appropriate for modern JavaScript development. The inclusion of the `"use client";` banner is particularly notable as it specifies client-side execution context, which is crucial for compatibility with certain environments like NextJS.

</blockquote></details>
<details><summary>packages/core/react/tsup.config.ts (1)</summary><blockquote>

`8-8`: The addition of the `"use client";` banner in the React package's `tsup` configuration is consistent with the changes in the system package. This ensures uniformity across builds and clarifies the client-side usage intent, which is essential for frameworks like NextJS.

</blockquote></details>
<details><summary>packages/utilities/react-rsc-utils/src/index.ts (1)</summary><blockquote>

`1-4`: The restructuring to named exports in `react-rsc-utils` enhances clarity and maintainability. Each export is clearly defined, which improves the modularity and ease of import in consumer applications. This change aligns with modern JavaScript best practices.

</blockquote></details>
<details><summary>.changeset/clean-olives-cross.md (1)</summary><blockquote>

`1-8`: The changeset documentation clearly outlines the patches applied to various packages and summarizes the key changes, including the named exports and the `"use client";` directive. This documentation is essential for tracking changes and understanding the scope of the update.

</blockquote></details>
<details><summary>packages/core/system-rsc/src/index.ts (1)</summary><blockquote>

`1-31`: The restructuring of exports in `system-rsc` to named exports is comprehensive and well-organized. The explicit export of types and utility functions enhances the modularity and clarity of the package, making it easier for developers to import only what they need. This change is in line with best practices for maintainability and scalability.

### Chat

There are 3 ways to chat with [CodeRabbit](https://coderabbit.ai):

- Review comments: Directly reply to a review comment made by CodeRabbit. Example:
	- `I pushed a fix in commit <commit_id>.`
	- `Generate unit testing code for this file.`
	- `Open a follow-up GitHub issue for this discussion.`
- Files and specific lines of code (under the "Files changed" tab): Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new review comment at the desired location with your query. Examples:
	- `@coderabbitai generate unit testing code for this file.`
	-	`@coderabbitai modularize this function.`
- PR comments: Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new PR comment to ask questions about the PR branch. For the best results, please provide a very specific query, as very limited context is provided in this mode. Examples:
	- `@coderabbitai generate interesting stats about this repository and render them as a table.`
	- `@coderabbitai show all the console.log statements in this repository.`
	- `@coderabbitai read src/utils.ts and generate unit testing code.`
	- `@coderabbitai read the files in the src/scheduler package and generate a class diagram using mermaid and a README in the markdown format.`

Note: Be mindful of the bot's finite context window. It's strongly recommended to break down tasks such as reading entire modules into smaller chunks. For a focused discussion, use review comments to chat about specific files and their changes, instead of using the PR comments.

### CodeRabbit Commands (invoked as PR comments)
