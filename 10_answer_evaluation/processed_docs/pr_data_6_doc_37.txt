## Walkthrough

This update introduces a patch for the `@nextui-org/link` library to address a deprecated `onClick` warning, replacing it with `onPress` for better compliance with current best practices. Additionally, the import statement for the `useLink` functionality was changed to source from `@nextui-org/use-aria-link`, reflecting a shift in its implementation. These changes enhance the library's reliability and compatibility, particularly regarding accessibility features.

Specifically, the import of `useLink` from `@react-aria/link` has been replaced with `useAriaLink` from `@nextui-org/use-aria-link`. This change indicates a shift in the source of the hook being utilized, likely to align with updated library usage or to address deprecation warnings associated with the previous import. Additionally, a comment has been added to clarify the purpose of using the new import, specifically mentioning it is to suppress an onClick deprecation warning. The overall functionality of the `useLink` function remains intact, but the underlying implementation has been updated to improve compatibility or maintainability.

## PR Summary

The pull request titled "fix(link): deprecated onClick warning on using onPress" addresses a console warning that arises when using the `onPress` event with the `Button` component rendered as a `Link`. The warning message indicates that "onClick is deprecated, please use onPress." This issue was reported by a user who encountered the warning while utilizing the `as` prop to render a `Link` component as a `Button`. The PR resolves this warning by ensuring proper implementation of the `onPress` event when the `Button` is used as a `Link`. Importantly, the change does not introduce any breaking changes, allowing existing users to continue using the components without needing to modify their code. This pull request also closes issue #3196, which specifically discusses the deprecation warning faced by users.

## Objectives from Linked Issues

The linked issue #3196 highlights a problem where users receive a deprecation warning for `onClick` even when it is not explicitly used in their code. The discussion originated when a user, bllakcn, reported encountering the warning while attempting to render a `Link` as a `Button` using the `as` prop. The user provided a code snippet that included the `onPress` prop but still triggered the warning. The objective of the issue is to determine whether this behavior results from a misuse of the API or if it is a bug within the library. The PR aims to clarify this situation by fixing the underlying implementation, ensuring that users can effectively use the `onPress` event without encountering deprecated warnings.

## Comments Summary

In the comments on the pull request, the contributor, awesome-pro, mentions that they have updated the `@react-aria/link` package to the latest version and that no further updates are available. This statement prompted a response from wingkwong, who pointed out a contradiction in the comments. Wingkwong requested clarification regarding a previous mention of "step 2," which was not clearly defined in the context of the discussion. 

The conversation indicates a need for better communication regarding the steps taken to resolve the issue and the status of dependencies. Wingkwong's comment suggests that if a new version of `@react-aria/link` is released and the problem persists, there should be an effort to synchronize any differences back to the custom package `@nextui-org/use-aria-link`. This highlights the importance of maintaining consistency across dependencies and ensuring that the library functions as intended without generating deprecated warnings.

Overall, the comments reflect a collaborative effort to address the issue raised in the pull request and to ensure that the implementation aligns with the expectations of the library's users. The discussion emphasizes the need for clear communication and thorough testing when dealing with updates to external dependencies.

### Chat

There are 3 ways to chat with [CodeRabbit](https://coderabbit.ai):

- Review comments: Directly reply to a review comment made by CodeRabbit. Example:
	- `I pushed a fix in commit <commit_id>.`
	- `Generate unit testing code for this file.`
	- `Open a follow-up GitHub issue for this discussion.`
- Files and specific lines of code (under the "Files changed" tab): Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new review comment at the desired location with your query. Examples:
	- `@coderabbitai generate unit testing code for this file.`
	-	`@coderabbitai modularize this function.`
- PR comments: Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new PR comment to ask questions about the PR branch. For the best results, please provide a very specific query, as very limited context is provided in this mode. Examples:
	- `@coderabbitai generate interesting stats about this repository and render them as a table.`
	- `@coderabbitai show all the console.log statements in this repository.`
	- `@coderabbitai read src/utils.ts and generate unit testing code.`
	- `@coderabbitai read the files in the src/scheduler package and generate a class diagram using mermaid and a README in the markdown format.`
	- `@coderabbitai help me debug CodeRabbit configuration file.`

Note: Be mindful of the bot's finite context window. It's strongly recommended to break down tasks such as reading entire modules into smaller chunks. For a focused discussion, use review comments to chat about specific files and their changes, instead of using the PR comments.

both statement are contradicted

> Can you explain a bit what you meant in step 2

This is not step 2. I mean if there is a new version of `@react-aria/link` and it doesn't work. Then sync the difference back to our custom package `@nextui-org/use-aria-link`.\n- wingkwong: Just checked myself. No new logic introduced in RA side. Good to use `@nextui-org/use-aria-link` back.\n
