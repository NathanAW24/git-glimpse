Description:
Closes # 
üìù Description
Due to next/link doesn't support multiple children we have to wrap the NextUI children into a fragment
‚õ≥Ô∏è Current behavior (updates)
It's not possible to use the NextUI link as a next/link thought the as prop
üöÄ New behaviour
NextUI children were wrapped into a React Fragment in order to support next/link, NextUI will be able to use it as follows:
import NextLink from "next/link";
import { Link } from "@nextui-org/react"

export default function App() {
  return (
    <Link href="#" as={NextLink}>
      "First solve the problem. Then, write the code." - Jon Johnson.
    </Link>
  );
}


üí£ Is this a breaking change (Yes/No): No
