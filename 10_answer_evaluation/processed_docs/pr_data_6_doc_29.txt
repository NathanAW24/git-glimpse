## Walkthrough

The recent changes to the `react-rsc-utils` package involve modifications to its `package.json` file, specifically the addition of `peerDependencies` for React version 18 or higher. This ensures that the package does not bundle its own version of React, thereby avoiding conflicts and reducing bundle size. The `devDependencies` section has also been updated to reflect compatibility with React 18, aligning the package with modern standards.

# Existing changesets

packages/utilities/react-rsc-utils/package.json: ## AI-generated summary of changes

The diff introduces modifications to the `package.json` file for the `react-rsc-utils` package. A new section for `peerDependencies` has been added, specifying that the package requires React version 18 or higher. This change indicates a shift in the package's compatibility requirements, ensuring that users of `react-rsc-utils` are using a compatible version of React. Additionally, the `devDependencies` section has been updated to include React with a version constraint of `^18.0.0`, indicating that any minor or patch version of React 18 is acceptable for development purposes. These adjustments reflect an enhancement in the package's dependency management, aligning it with modern React standards.



## Alterations to the declarations of exported or public entities

- `"peerDependencies": { "react": ">=18" }` in `packages/utilities/react-rsc-utils/package.json`
- `"react": "^18.0.0"` in `devDependencies` of `packages/utilities/react-rsc-utils/package.json`


# New changesets

.changeset/tall-balloons-sleep.md: ## AI-generated summary of changes

This update introduces a modification to the `react-rsc-utils` package by adding `react` to its `peerDependencies`. This change is aimed at preventing the bundling of a separate copy of React within the `react-rsc-utils` package, thus ensuring that the application using this package will rely on its own version of React. This adjustment enhances compatibility and reduces potential issues related to multiple instances of React being loaded in the same application. The change is straightforward but crucial for maintaining a clean dependency structure and optimizing the overall application performance.

## PR Summary

The pull request titled "refactor(deps): remove react copy from react-rsc-utils bundle" addresses the issue of the `react-rsc-utils` package bundling its own copy of React. This practice increases the overall bundle size and creates compatibility issues with Preact. The PR closes issue #3531, which highlights the problem of bundled React in version `2.0.13` of `@nextui-org/react-rsc-utils`. The current behavior shows that React is included directly in the package, as evidenced by a code snippet from the bundled file. The proposed change involves modifying the package to import React as a peer dependency instead of bundling it, aligning with practices used in other packages like `react-utils`. The PR includes visual comparisons of the bundle sizes before and after the change, demonstrating a reduction in size. The author has not indicated whether this change is a breaking change for existing users.

## Objectives from Linked Issues

The linked issue #3531 outlines the need to eliminate the bundled copy of React within the `react-rsc-utils` package. The primary objective is to reduce the bundle size and ensure compatibility with Preact, which cannot coexist with multiple instances of React. The issue describes how the current implementation includes React directly in the package, leading to increased size and potential conflicts. The expected behavior is for React to be specified as a peer dependency, allowing users to manage their own React version without duplication. This approach is consistent with practices seen in other packages within the NextUI ecosystem, such as `react-utils`, which appropriately lists React in `peerDependencies`. Resolving this issue is crucial for improving the efficiency and compatibility of the NextUI library with various React alternatives.

<summary>Tips</summary>

### Chat

There are 3 ways to chat with [CodeRabbit](https://coderabbit.ai):

- Review comments: Directly reply to a review comment made by CodeRabbit. Example:
	- `I pushed a fix in commit <commit_id>.`
	- `Generate unit testing code for this file.`
	- `Open a follow-up GitHub issue for this discussion.`
- Files and specific lines of code (under the "Files changed" tab): Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new review comment at the desired location with your query. Examples:
	- `@coderabbitai generate unit testing code for this file.`
	-	`@coderabbitai modularize this function.`
- PR comments: Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new PR comment to ask questions about the PR branch. For the best results, please provide a very specific query, as very limited context is provided in this mode. Examples:
	- `@coderabbitai generate interesting stats about this repository and render them as a table.`
	- `@coderabbitai show all the console.log statements in this repository.`
	- `@coderabbitai read src/utils.ts and generate unit testing code.`
	- `@coderabbitai read the files in the src/scheduler package and generate a class diagram using mermaid and a README in the markdown format.`
	- `@coderabbitai help me debug CodeRabbit configuration file.`

Note: Be mindful of the bot's finite context window. It's strongly recommended to break down tasks such as reading entire modules into smaller chunks. For a focused discussion, use review comments to chat about specific files and their changes, instead of using the PR comments.

### CodeRabbit Commands (invoked as PR comments)

- `@coderabbitai pause` to pause the reviews on a PR.
- `@coderabbitai resume` to resume the paused reviews.
- `@coderabbitai review` to trigger an incremental review. This is useful when automatic reviews are disabled for the repository.
- `@coderabbitai full review` to do a full review from scratch and review all the files again.
- `@coderabbitai summary` to regenerate the summary of the PR.
- `@coderabbitai resolve` resolve all the CodeRabbit review comments.
- `@coderabbitai configuration` to show the current CodeRabbit configuration for the repository.
- `@coderabbitai help` to get help.


Additionally, you can add `@coderabbitai ignore` anywhere in the PR description to prevent this PR from being reviewed.

### CodeRabbit Configuration File (`.coderabbit.yaml`)

- You can programmatically configure CodeRabbit by adding a `.coderabbit.yaml` file to the root of your repository.
- Please see the [configuration documentation](https://docs.coderabbit.ai/guides/configure-coderabbit) for more information.
- If your editor has YAML language server enabled, you can add the path at the top of this file to enable auto-completion and validation: `# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://coderabbit.ai/integrations/schema.v2.json`
