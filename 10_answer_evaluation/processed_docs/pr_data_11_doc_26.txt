## Walkthrough

This update introduces several new GitHub Actions workflows for managing pre-release modes, including processes to enter and exit pre-release modes and handle beta and canary versions. Additionally, it updates scripts in `package.json` and modifies dependency versions in specific files to align with these new modes.

```markdown
.github/workflows/enter-pre-release-mode.yaml: ## Summary
The new file `.github/workflows/enter-pre-release-mode.yaml` introduces a workflow that triggers when a manual workflow dispatch occurs. It includes steps to configure the repository for pre-release mode based on the branch being `beta/release-next` or `canary`.

## Alterations to the declarations of exported or public entities
No alterations to the declarations of exported or public entities were made in this file.

---

.github/workflows/exit-pre-release.yaml: ## Summary

The new file `exit-pre-release.yaml` introduces a GitHub Actions workflow that automates the process of exiting pre-release mode on a beta release branch. It includes steps to checkout the branch, install dependencies, remove a specific file, and commit the changes to the repository.

---

.github/workflows/pre-release.yaml: ## Summary
The `pre-release.yaml` workflow file introduces a pre-release process triggered by pushes to specific branches. It checks for changesets and packages, creates pre-release PRs, and publishes to NPM for beta versions.

## Alterations to the declarations of exported or public entities
- N/A

---

.github/workflows/release.yaml: ## Summary
The changes in the `.github/workflows/release.yaml` file primarily involve modifications to the triggering conditions for the GitHub Actions workflow and the removal of specific job steps. The workflow is now set to trigger on the `main` branch instead of the `canary` branch, indicating a shift in the deployment strategy. Additionally, several steps related to syncing files from the `canary` branch to the `main` branch and creating a canary release have been removed, simplifying the release process.

## Alterations to the declarations of exported or public entities
- Removed: Syncing files from `canary` to `main` branch upon publish in the workflow.
- Removed: Creation of canary release in the workflow.

---

package.json: ## Summary
Added two new scripts `"changeset:canary": "changeset pre enter canary"` and `"changeset:beta": "changeset pre enter beta"` to the `package.json` file for managing changeset versions. This enhancement provides a more structured approach to versioning and release management.

## Alterations to the declarations of exported or public entities
- Added: `"changeset:canary": "changeset pre enter canary"` in `package.json`
- Added: `"changeset:beta": "changeset pre enter beta"` in `package.json`

---

apps/docs/components/sandpack/use-sandpack.ts: ## Summary
In the file `use-sandpack.ts` within the `apps/docs/components/sandpack` directory, the changes involve updating the dependency versions from `"dev-v2"` to `"canary"` for `@nextui-org/theme`, `@nextui-org/system`, and `@nextui-org/react`. This change indicates a shift from a development version to a canary version, which may impact the stability and features available in the Sandpack environment.

## Alterations to the declarations of exported or public entities
- Modified: Dependency versions in the `useSandpack` function in `apps/docs/components/sandpack/use-sandpack.ts` for the following packages:
  - `@nextui-org/theme`: "dev-v2" ‚Üí "canary"
  - `@nextui-org/system`: "dev-v2" ‚Üí "canary"
  - `@nextui-org/react`: "dev-v2" ‚Üí "canary"
  - Dynamic dependencies for components in `nextUIComponents`: "dev-v2" ‚Üí "canary"

---

apps/docs/preinstall.js: ## Summary

In `apps/docs/preinstall.js`, the change involves updating the npm command from `npm show ${pkg}@dev-v2 version` to `npm show ${pkg}@canary version` to fetch the latest version of a package under a different tag.
```

## PR summary

**Title:** feat: pre-release workflow

**User:** wingkwong

**Number:** 2910

**Description:**

This pull request introduces a pre-release workflow with specific assumptions:
- The default branch is `canary`.
- The `main` branch is intended to serve as a snapshot of the current production.
- The file `pre.json` should not exist in the `main` branch.

### Pre-release

The workflow includes two examples for pre-release processes:
1. Beta/release-next
2. Canary

Images are provided to illustrate the pre-release workflow for both examples.

### Enter Pre-release
- The process is triggered manually through GitHub Actions.
- It only supports the `canary` or `beta/release-next` branches.
- A `pre.json` file will be generated upon entering the pre-release phase.

### Exit Pre-release
- This phase is also triggered manually via GitHub Actions.
- It supports only the `canary` or `beta/release-next` branches.
- The `pre.json` file will be deleted after exiting the pre-release phase.

### Additional Info
- The workflow requires `read:user` and `repo:status` permissions to successfully exit the pre-release phase.

<summary>.github/workflows/release.yaml (2)</summary><blockquote>

`9-9`: **LGTM!**

The change in the trigger branch from `canary` to `main` aligns with the PR objective of using the `main` branch as a snapshot for the current production. This indicates a shift in the deployment strategy to focus on the `main` branch for releases.

---

`42-42`: **LGTM!**

The addition of the `GITHUB_TOKEN` secret ensures that the workflow has the necessary permissions to interact with the GitHub API for creating release pull requests or publishing releases.

<details>
<summary>package.json (2)</summary><blockquote>

`49-49`: **LGTM!**

The `"changeset:canary": "changeset pre enter canary"` script aligns with the updated understanding of `canary` as a pre-release mode. Good job updating this based on the previous discussion!

---

`50-50`: **Looks good!**

The `"changeset:beta": "changeset pre enter beta"` script follows the same pattern as the `changeset:canary` script and aligns with the PR objective of introducing scripts for managing pre-release modes. Nice work!

<summary>Tips</summary>

### Chat

There are 3 ways to chat with [CodeRabbit](https://coderabbit.ai):

- Review comments: Directly reply to a review comment made by CodeRabbit. Example:
-- `I pushed a fix in commit <commit_id>, please review it.`
-- `Generate unit testing code for this file.`
	- `Open a follow-up GitHub issue for this discussion.`
- Files and specific lines of code (under the "Files changed" tab): Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new review comment at the desired location with your query. Examples:
-- `@coderabbitai generate unit testing code for this file.`
--	`@coderabbitai modularize this function.`
- PR comments: Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new PR comment to ask questions about the PR branch. For the best results, please provide a very specific query, as very limited context is provided in this mode. Examples:
-- `@coderabbitai generate interesting stats about this repository and render them as a table.`
-- `@coderabbitai read src/utils.ts and generate unit testing code.`
-- `@coderabbitai read the files in the src/scheduler package and generate a class diagram using mermaid and a README in the markdown format.`
-- `@coderabbitai help me debug CodeRabbit configuration file.`

Note: Be mindful of the bot's finite context window. It's strongly recommended to break down tasks such as reading entire modules into smaller chunks. For a focused discussion, use review comments to chat about specific files and their changes, instead of using the PR comments.

### CodeRabbit Commands (Invoked using PR comments)

- `@coderabbitai pause` to pause the reviews on a PR.
- `@coderabbitai resume` to resume the paused reviews.
- `@coderabbitai review` to trigger an incremental review. This is useful when automatic reviews are disabled for the repository.
- `@coderabbitai full review` to do a full review from scratch and review all the files again.
- `@coderabbitai summary` to regenerate the summary of the PR.
- `@coderabbitai resolve` resolve all the CodeRabbit review comments.
- `@coderabbitai configuration` to show the current CodeRabbit configuration for the repository.
- `@coderabbitai help` to get help.

### Other keywords and placeholders

- Add `@coderabbitai ignore` anywhere in the PR description to prevent this PR from being reviewed.
- Add `@coderabbitai summary` to generate the high-level summary at a specific location in the PR description.
- Add `@coderabbitai` anywhere in the PR title to generate the title automatically.

### Documentation and Community

- Visit our [Documentation](https://coderabbit.ai/docs) for detailed information on how to use CodeRabbit.
- Join our [Discord Community](https://discord.com/invite/GsXnASn26c) to get help, request features, and share feedback.
