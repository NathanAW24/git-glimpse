## Walkthrough

The recent changes address issues in the `@nextui-org/calendar` and `@nextui-org/theme` packages, focusing on the `DateRangePicker` component's display of multiple months. The updates ensure that the width of the calendar content dynamically adjusts based on the number of visible months, resolving display problems that occurred when `visibleMonths` was set to values greater than one.

## Changes

| Files/Groups | Change Summary |
|--------------|----------------|
| `packages/components/calendar/src/use-calendar-base.ts` | Modified `useCalendarBase` function to handle `visibleMonths` and `calendarWidth` properties by converting them to strings if they are numbers, setting these as CSS variables. |
| `packages/core/theme/src/components/date-picker.ts` | Updated width calculations for `calendar` and `calendarContent` elements to dynamically adjust based on the number of visible months using CSS variables. |

## Assessment against linked issues

| Objective (Issue #) | Addressed | Explanation |
|---------------------|-----------|-------------|
| Fix display of multiple months in `DateRangePicker` when `visibleMonths` is greater than 1 (#3504) | ‚úÖ | |

.changeset/short-garlics-wink.md: ## AI-generated summary of changes

The new file introduces patches for `@nextui-org/calendar` and `@nextui-org/theme`. It includes a fix for the `calendarContent` width to align it with the visible month.

---

packages/components/calendar/src/use-calendar-base.ts: ## AI-generated summary of changes

The `useCalendarBase` function in `use-calendar-base.ts` now handles the `visibleMonths` and `calendarWidth` properties differently by converting them to strings if they are numbers before setting CSS variables.

## Alterations to the declarations of exported or public entities

- `export function useCalendarBase(originalProps: UseCalendarBasePropsComplete)` in `use-calendar-base.ts`
- `--visible-months: visibleMonths` in `use-calendar-base.ts`
- `--calendar-width: calendarWidth` in `use-calendar-base.ts`

---

packages/core/theme/src/components/date-picker.ts: ## AI-generated summary of changes

The functionality of the `datePicker` component in `packages/core/theme/src/components/date-picker.ts` has been altered. Specifically, the width calculation for the calendar and calendar content elements now dynamically adjusts based on the number of visible months. This change introduces a new calculation method using CSS variables to determine the width, replacing the static width definitions.

## Alterations to the declarations of exported or public entities

- `calendar: "w-[var(--calendar-width)] shadow-none"` in `date-picker.ts` ‚Üí `calendar: "w-[calc(var(--visible-months)_*_var(--calendar-width))] shadow-none"`
- `calendarContent: "w-[var(--calendar-width)]"` in `date-picker.ts` ‚Üí `calendarContent: "w-[calc(var(--visible-months)_*_var(--calendar-width))]"

## PR Summary

**Title:** fix(date-range-picker): calendar-content width as per visible-months  
**User:** abhinandan-verma  
**Number:** 3505  
**URL:** [https://github.com/nextui-org/nextui/pull/3505](https://github.com/nextui-org/nextui/pull/3505)  

**Description:**  
This pull request addresses the issue of the `calendar` and `calendarContent` width in the `calendar`, `date-picker`, and `date-range-picker` components. The width is now adjusted according to the `visibleMonths` property. This change ensures that the calendar content displays correctly when multiple months are set to be visible.

**Current Behavior:**  
The calendar view is broken when the `visibleMonths` property is set to a value higher than 1. Only the first month's table is shown, while the calendar header displays correctly.

**New Behavior:**  
The calendar content width is fixed to accommodate the number of months specified by the `visibleMonths` property, ensuring all months are visible in the calendar view.

**Breaking Change:** No

## Objectives from Linked Issues

**Linked Issue:** #3504  

**Title:** [BUG] - DateRangePicker not showing multiple months correctly after 2.4.3 update  

**Description:**  
The issue describes a bug in the DateRangePicker component where the calendar view is broken when the `visibleMonths` property is set to a value higher than 1. The calendar header shows correctly, but only the first month's table is displayed.

**Steps to Reproduce the Bug or Issue:**
1. Add the `visibleMonths` attribute to the DateRangePicker.
2. Observe that the calendar view is broken, showing only the first month.

**Expected Behavior:**  
All the months specified by the `visibleMonths` property should be visible in the calendar view.

### Chat

There are 3 ways to chat with [CodeRabbit](https://coderabbit.ai):

- Review comments: Directly reply to a review comment made by CodeRabbit. Example:
	- `I pushed a fix in commit <commit_id>.`
	- `Generate unit testing code for this file.`
	- `Open a follow-up GitHub issue for this discussion.`
- Files and specific lines of code (under the "Files changed" tab): Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new review comment at the desired location with your query. Examples:
	- `@coderabbitai generate unit testing code for this file.`
	-	`@coderabbitai modularize this function.`
- PR comments: Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new PR comment to ask questions about the PR branch. For the best results, please provide a very specific query, as very limited context is provided in this mode. Examples:
	- `@coderabbitai generate interesting stats about this repository and render them as a table.`
	- `@coderabbitai show all the console.log statements in this repository.`
	- `@coderabbitai read src/utils.ts and generate unit testing code.`
	- `@coderabbitai read the files in the src/scheduler package and generate a class diagram using mermaid and a README in the markdown format.`
	- `@coderabbitai help me debug CodeRabbit configuration file.`

Note: Be mindful of the bot's finite context window. It's strongly recommended to break down tasks such as reading entire modules into smaller chunks. For a focused discussion, use review comments to chat about specific files and their changes, instead of using the PR comments.

### CodeRabbit Commands (invoked as PR comments)

- `@coderabbitai pause` to pause the reviews on a PR.
- `@coderabbitai resume` to resume the paused reviews.
- `@coderabbitai review` to trigger an incremental review. This is useful when automatic reviews are disabled for the repository.
- `@coderabbitai full review` to do a full review from scratch and review all the files again.
- `@coderabbitai summary` to regenerate the summary of the PR.
- `@coderabbitai resolve` resolve all the CodeRabbit review comments.
- `@coderabbitai configuration` to show the current CodeRabbit configuration for the repository.
- `@coderabbitai help` to get help.


Additionally, you can add `@coderabbitai ignore` anywhere in the PR description to prevent this PR from being reviewed.

### CodeRabbit Configuration File (`.coderabbit.yaml`)

- You can programmatically configure CodeRabbit by adding a `.coderabbit.yaml` file to the root of your repository.
- Please see the [configuration documentation](https://docs.coderabbit.ai/guides/configure-coderabbit) for more information.
- If your editor has YAML language server enabled, you can add the path at the top of this file to enable auto-completion and validation: `# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://coderabbit.ai/integrations/schema.v2.json`
