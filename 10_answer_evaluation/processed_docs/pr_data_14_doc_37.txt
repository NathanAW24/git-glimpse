### PR Objectives

The pull request, numbered 2541 and titled "chore(badge): Remove unnecessary type," focuses on refining a component library by removing the `children` type from the `BadgeProps` interface. This adjustment is proposed to streamline the interface declaration, as the `BadgeProps` interface inherits the `children` prop from `UseBadgeProps`, eliminating the need for redundant type declarations. The primary objective is to enhance code cleanliness and maintainability without introducing any breaking changes, ensuring compatibility with existing code utilizing the `BadgeProps` interface.

### Comments Summary

The contributor, withden, has included a changeset file and expressed readiness for any additional requirements during the review process. No specific actions or clarifications are requested beyond this preparation.

### AI-generated Summary of Generated Summaries

In the `badge.tsx` file of the component library, the `children` property is removed from the `BadgeProps` interface to simplify the declaration. This change eliminates redundancy as the `children` prop is already present in the extended `UseBadgeProps` interface. The modification aims to improve code clarity and maintainability without causing any disruptions, ensuring seamless compatibility with existing implementations and user code.

### Chat

There are 3 ways to chat with CodeRabbit:

- Review comments: Directly reply to a review comment made by CodeRabbit. Example:
	- `I pushed a fix in commit <commit_id>.`
	- `Generate unit-tests for this file.`
	- `Open a follow-up GitHub issue for this discussion.`
- Files and specific lines of code (under the "Files changed" tab): Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new review comment at the desired location with your query. Examples:
	- `@coderabbitai generate unit tests for this file.`
	-	`@coderabbitai modularize this function.`
- PR comments: Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new PR comment to ask questions about the PR branch. For the best results, please provide a very specific query, as very limited context is provided in this mode. Examples:
	- `@coderabbitai generate interesting stats about this repository and render them as a table.`
	- `@coderabbitai show all the console.log statements in this repository.`
	- `@coderabbitai read src/utils.ts and generate unit tests.`
	- `@coderabbitai read the files in the src/scheduler package and generate a class diagram using mermaid and a README in the markdown format.`

Note: Be mindful of the bot's finite context window. It's strongly recommended to break down tasks such as reading entire modules into smaller chunks. For a focused discussion, use review comments to chat about specific files and their changes, instead of using the PR comments.
