## Walkthrough

This update introduces a workflow modification where the `develop` branch, alongside the `main` branch, will now trigger workflow runs. This enhancement aims to streamline development and testing processes by allowing actions to execute in both primary branches, ensuring that changes in `develop` are as stable as those in `main` before merging.

### PR Objectives (user provided facts)

The pull request (PR) titled "chore(root): add develop branch to release workflow" with the number 2496 aims to modify the project's release workflow by incorporating the `develop` branch into the workflow triggers. This change is intended to allow workflow runs to be initiated not only from the `main` branch, as is currently the case, but also from the `develop` branch. The description provided in the PR lacks specific details about the current behavior and the exact changes made, as well as the rationale behind these changes. However, it mentions that the PR is focused on a chore type task, implying that it deals with maintenance or minor improvements rather than adding new features or fixing bugs.

The PR does not specify an associated GitHub issue, as indicated by the placeholder text "Closes # <!-- Github issue # here -->" left unfilled. This suggests that the PR may have been initiated without a corresponding issue or that the submitter forgot to link the relevant issue. The description sections intended to provide more context about the current behavior, new behavior, and whether the change is a breaking one are left with prompts for information rather than actual descriptions. This lack of detail means that the rationale, expected impact, and potential migration paths for existing users are not clearly communicated within the PR description.

Despite the sparse description, the core objective of the PR is clear: to update the `.github/workflows/release.yaml` file to include the `develop` branch in the release workflow triggers. This change is presumably aimed at improving the development and release process by allowing actions that were previously restricted to the `main` branch to also be performed from the `develop` branch, potentially facilitating a more flexible or staged approach to integration and deployment.

### AI-generated Summary of Generated Summaries

The pull request introduces a modification to the project's GitHub Actions workflow configuration, specifically within the `.github/workflows/release.yaml` file. The key change involves adding the `develop` branch to the list of branches that can trigger the release workflow. Previously, only the `main` branch was configured to initiate workflow runs. By including the `develop` branch, the project aims to enhance its development and release process, allowing for a more dynamic and possibly staged approach to testing, integration, and deployment. This change is targeted at improving workflow efficiency and flexibility without altering the core functionality or introducing new features.

### Chat

There are 3 ways to chat with CodeRabbit:

- Review comments: Directly reply to a review comment made by CodeRabbit. Example:
	- `I pushed a fix in commit <commit_id>.`
	- `Generate unit-tests for this file.`
	- `Open a follow-up GitHub issue for this discussion.`
- Files and specific lines of code (under the "Files changed" tab): Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new review comment at the desired location with your query. Examples:
	- `@coderabbitai generate unit tests for this file.`
	-	`@coderabbitai modularize this function.`
- PR comments: Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new PR comment to ask questions about the PR branch. For the best results, please provide a very specific query, as very limited context is provided in this mode. Examples:
	- `@coderabbitai generate interesting stats about this repository and render them as a table.`
	- `@coderabbitai show all the console.log statements in this repository.`
	- `@coderabbitai read src/utils.ts and generate unit tests.`
	- `@coderabbitai read the files in the src/scheduler package and generate a class diagram using mermaid and a README in the markdown format.`

Note: Be mindful of the bot's finite context window. It's strongly recommended to break down tasks such as reading entire modules into smaller chunks. For a focused discussion, use review comments to chat about specific files and their changes, instead of using the PR comments.

### CodeRabbit Commands (invoked as PR comments)

- `@coderabbitai pause` to pause the reviews on a PR.
- `@coderabbitai resume` to resume the paused reviews.
- `@coderabbitai review` to trigger a review. This is useful when automatic reviews are disabled for the repository.
- `@coderabbitai resolve` resolve all the CodeRabbit review comments.
- `@coderabbitai help` to get help.


Additionally, you can add `@coderabbitai ignore` anywhere in the PR description to prevent this PR from being reviewed.
