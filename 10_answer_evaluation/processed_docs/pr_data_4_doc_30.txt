## PR Summary

The pull request titled "chore: comment out section prompts in PR template" was submitted by the user ryo-manba and is identified as number 3884 on GitHub. The primary objective of this PR is to modify the existing pull request template used in the NextUI project.

The description outlines that some contributors have been leaving the default text in the PR body, which can lead to confusion. To mitigate this issue, the prompts in the PR template have been converted into comments. This change aims to clarify the template's usage and prevent contributors from mistakenly submitting the default instructions.

The PR does not introduce any new features or changes to the functionality of the codebase but focuses solely on improving the clarity of the contribution process. It emphasizes the importance of keeping pull requests concise and relevant to a single type of change, such as documentation, features, refactoring, continuous integration, repository updates, or bug fixes.

Additionally, the PR template includes sections for contributors to describe the current behavior being modified, the new behavior introduced, and whether the changes constitute a breaking change, along with any necessary migration paths for existing users. However, these sections are now commented out to avoid confusion during the submission process.

For further details, the PR can be accessed at the provided GitHub URL: [https://github.com/nextui-org/nextui/pull/3884](https://github.com/nextui-org/nextui/pull/3884).

### Chat

There are 3 ways to chat with [CodeRabbit](https://coderabbit.ai):

- Review comments: Directly reply to a review comment made by CodeRabbit. Example:
  - `I pushed a fix in commit <commit_id>, please review it.`
  - `Generate unit testing code for this file.`
  - `Open a follow-up GitHub issue for this discussion.`
- Files and specific lines of code (under the "Files changed" tab): Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new review comment at the desired location with your query. Examples:
  - `@coderabbitai generate unit testing code for this file.`
  -	`@coderabbitai modularize this function.`
- PR comments: Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new PR comment to ask questions about the PR branch. For the best results, please provide a very specific query, as very limited context is provided in this mode. Examples:
  - `@coderabbitai gather interesting stats about this repository and render them as a table. Additionally, render a pie chart showing the language distribution in the codebase.`
  - `@coderabbitai read src/utils.ts and generate unit testing code.`
  - `@coderabbitai read the files in the src/scheduler package and generate a class diagram using mermaid and a README in the markdown format.`
  - `@coderabbitai help me debug CodeRabbit configuration file.`

Note: Be mindful of the bot's finite context window. It's strongly recommended to break down tasks such as reading entire modules into smaller chunks. For a focused discussion, use review comments to chat about specific files and their changes, instead of using the PR comments.

### CodeRabbit Commands (Invoked using PR comments)

- `@coderabbitai pause` to pause the reviews on a PR.
- `@coderabbitai resume` to resume the paused reviews.
- `@coderabbitai review` to trigger an incremental review. This is useful when automatic reviews are disabled for the repository.
- `@coderabbitai full review` to do a full review from scratch and review all the files again.
- `@coderabbitai summary` to regenerate the summary of the PR.
- `@coderabbitai resolve` resolve all the CodeRabbit review comments.
- `@coderabbitai configuration` to show the current CodeRabbit configuration for the repository.
- `@coderabbitai help` to get help.

### Other keywords and placeholders

- Add `@coderabbitai ignore` anywhere in the PR description to prevent this PR from being reviewed.
- Add `@coderabbitai summary` to generate the high-level summary at a specific location in the PR description.
- Add `@coderabbitai` anywhere in the PR title to generate the title automatically.
