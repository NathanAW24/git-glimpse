      "Query: onClick event handling best practices\nFile: pr_data_25_doc_10.txt\nSummary: ### Summary of PR #974: Fix Tooltip Trigger Click Event\n\n**Context:**\nThis pull request addresses an issue where the tooltip was not displayed upon clicking the trigger. The solution involved changing the event handler from `onClick` to `onClickCapture`.\n\n**Code Changes:**\n- **File Modified:** `packages/react/src/tooltip/tooltip.tsx`\n- **Change Details:** \n  - The `onClick` event handler was replaced with `onClickCapture` for the `StyledTooltipTrigger` component.\n  - This change ensures that the click event is captured by the parent element before propagating to the child, allowing for better control over event handling.\n\n**Best Practices Observed:**\n- Utilizing `onClickCapture` can be beneficial when the parent element needs to handle the event before the child element does. This is particularly useful in scenarios where the child\u2019s behavior is dependent on the parent\u2019s event handling.\n\n**Insights from Discussions:**\n- The PR highlights the importance of understanding event propagation in React, specifically the difference between bubbling and capturing phases. This knowledge can help developers make informed decisions about event handling in their applications.\n\n**Utilities/Frameworks:**\n- The changes are made within the NextUI framework, which already provides a structured way to handle tooltips and events, preventing the need for developers to implement custom solutions for similar issues.\n\nThis PR is a good reference for developers looking to improve their understanding of event handling in React applications, particularly regarding the use of capturing events.",

    "reference_answer": "### General Answer Structure\n\n#### 1. Investigation / Analysis\n**Contextual Review:**  \nThe issue arises because the `helper-wrapper` div is being rendered unnecessarily when `isInvalid` is `false` but either `errorMessage` or `description` is present. This causes layout shifts, leading to a sliding problem in the UI.\n\n**Inspection of Existing Code and Behavior:**  \n- Current behavior: The `helper-wrapper` div is always created based on partial validation conditions, which results in unnecessary rendering.  \n- Affected components: `Input`, `Textarea`, and `Select`.\n\n**Relevant Files (to look at):**\n- `packages/components/input/src/input.tsx`: Contains logic for rendering helper wrappers in the Input component.  \n- `packages/components/input/src/textarea.tsx`: Manages the rendering logic for helper text in the Textarea component.  \n- `packages/components/select/src/select.tsx`: Handles the helper wrapper logic for the Select component.  \n\n**Error Analysis:**  \nThe issue stems from incomplete conditional logic for rendering helper wrappers. The helper wrapper is being rendered even when `isInvalid` is `false`, which leads to layout instability and unintended sliding effects in the UI.\n\n---\n\n#### 2. Proposed Solution / Implementation Steps\n**Files to create or add:**  \nNo new files are required.\n\n**High-Level Changes:**  \nRefactor the conditional rendering logic for helper wrappers to ensure that they are only rendered when necessary, i.e., when `isInvalid` is `true` or when `errorMessage` or `description` is provided.\n\n**Specific Technical Steps:**  \n1. **Update Conditional Rendering Logic:**  \n   - Modify the conditional checks in `input.tsx`, `textarea.tsx`, and `select.tsx` to include all relevant conditions (`isInvalid`, `errorMessage`, and `description`).  \n   - Ensure that the `helper-wrapper` div is not rendered if all these conditions are `false`.\n\n2. **Adjust JSX Structure:**  \n   - Update the JSX to simplify the rendering logic for helper text and wrappers in the affected files.\n\n3. **Refactor Props and Type Definitions:**  \n   - Update the `InputProps` and `SelectProps` type definitions to reflect the refined conditional logic and ensure better clarity for developers.\n\n4. **Enhance Code Readability:**  \n   - Refactor the helper-rendering logic into reusable functions or constants for better maintainability.\n\n---\n\n#### 3. Post-Fix / Post-Implementation Checks\n**Testing and Verification:**  \n- **Unit Tests:**  \n   - Add or update unit tests to validate that the `helper-wrapper` div renders only when necessary.  \n   - Test for various combinations of `isInvalid`, `errorMessage`, and `description` to ensure coverage of edge cases.  \n\n- **User Interaction Tests:**  \n   - Verify that the sliding issue is resolved and that there are no unintended layout shifts.\n\n- **Performance and Reliability:**  \n   - Confirm that rendering optimizations improve visual stability without introducing new issues.\n\n---\n\n#### 4.
