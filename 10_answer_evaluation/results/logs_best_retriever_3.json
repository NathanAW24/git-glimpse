It focuses on the Checkbox, Radio, and Switch components, ensuring that the `data-pressed` attribute is correctly applied and that the focus visible state behaves as expected on pointer clicks.\n\n**Key Code Changes:**\n- **Checkbox Component:** \n  - Added `labelProps` to the mergeProps function to ensure the `data-pressed` attribute is applied correctly.\n- **Radio Component:** \n  - Similar changes were made to include `labelProps` in the mergeProps function.\n- **Switch Component:** \n  - Adjusted to include `labelProps` in the mergeProps function, fixing the focus behavior.\n\n**Files Modified:**\n- `packages/components/checkbox/src/use-checkbox.ts`\n- `packages/components/radio/src/use-radio.ts`\n- `packages/components/switch/src/use-switch.ts`\n\n**Coding Conventions and Patterns:**\n- The PR utilizes the `mergeProps` function from React Aria to combine event handlers and attributes, which is a common pattern in React component libraries for managing props efficiently.\n- The use of `labelProps` from the respective hooks is a best practice to ensure accessibility and proper interaction behavior.\n\n**Best Practices and Insights:**\n- The changes ensure that the focus visible state is not incorrectly applied on pointer clicks, which is crucial for maintaining a good user experience.\n- The PR does not introduce breaking changes, making it safe to merge without affecting existing functionality.\n\n**Utilities and Frameworks:**\n- The PR leverages React Aria for accessibility features, which is already integrated into the project. Developers should utilize existing hooks and props from this library to avoid reinventing solutions.\n\nThis PR effectively resolves the checkbox selection issue while maintaining the integrity of related components, ensuring a consistent user experience across selection inputs.\n\n\n---\npr_data_6_doc_8.txt\n### Summary of Pull Request #3658\n\n**Context:**\nThis PR addresses issues related to component interactions within the NextUI framework, specifically focusing on the behavior of checkboxes, switches, and other interactive elements in a multi-selection table. It resolves issues #3544, #2324, and #2959 by implementing nested groups to prevent unintended interactions among components sharing the same parent.\n\n**Key Changes:**\n- **Nested Group Implementation:** The primary change involves applying nested groups to various components (checkboxes, switches, radios, etc.) to isolate their styles and behaviors. This prevents components from affecting each other when interacted with, such as toggling a switch when selecting a row.\n- **New Component:** Introduced `TableWithSwitchTemplate`, which integrates a `Switch` component into a table, allowing users to toggle active statuses without affecting row selection.\n  \n**Files Modified:**\n- `packages/core/theme/src/components/*.ts`: Multiple components (checkbox, radio, select, toggle, etc.) were updated to enhance CSS class specificity by adding component-specific suffixes (e.g., `/checkbox`, `/radio`).\n- `packages/components/table/stories/table.stories.tsx`: Added the new `TableWithSwitchTemplate` and its export.\n\n**Coding Conventions and Patterns:**\n- The PR follows a consistent naming convention for CSS classes, enhancing specificity and maintainability.\n- Utilizes the `tv` utility for defining component styles, ensuring a structured approach to styling.\n\n**Best Practices and Insights:**\n- The implementation of nested groups is a best practice for managing complex component interactions, particularly in UI frameworks where multiple interactive elements coexist.\n- Developers should ensure that any new components or modifications maintain this pattern to avoid similar issues in the future.\n\n**Utilities and Frameworks:**\n- The PR leverages the existing `@nextui-org/theme` library, ensuring that developers do not need to reinvent solutions for styling and component behavior.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThis PR significantly improves the usability of the multi-selection table component by isolating component behaviors, thus enhancing user experience and preventing unintended interactions. Developers should review the changes to understand the new structure and apply similar patterns in future developments.\n",

    "reference_answer": "### 1. Investigation / Analysis\n\n\n**Contextual Review:**  \nThe issue involves inconsistent `onClick` event handling in interactive components like `MenuItem`, `ListboxItem`, `Link`, and `Button`. The goal is to align the behavior with modern accessibility standards by deprecating `onClick` in favor of `onPress`, updating internal utilities, and reducing bundle size by removing unnecessary dependencies.\n\n**Inspection of Existing Code and Behavior:**  \nAnalyze the existing event-handling logic for the following components to identify how `onClick` is implemented and where it may cause inconsistencies or redundancies:\n- **MenuItem**: Verify the current implementation in `menu-item-base.tsx` and `use-menu-item.ts`.\n- **ListboxItem**: Inspect `listbox-item-base.tsx` and `use-listbox-item.ts`.\n- **Button**: Examine `use-button.ts` for `onClick` handling and its interactions with `onPress`.\n- **Link**: Check `use-link.ts` for `onClick` logic and ensure consistency in interaction handling.\n  \n**Relevant Files to Look At:**  \n- `menu-item-base.tsx` (Handles rendering and logic for menu items.)\n- `use-menu-item.ts` (Manages interaction logic for menu items.)\n- `listbox-item-base.tsx` (Handles rendering of listbox items.)\n- `use-listbox-item.ts` (Manages interaction logic for listbox items.)\n- `use-button.ts` (Core hook for button components.)\n- `use-link.ts` (Handles rendering and logic for links.)\n- Test files:\n  - `menu.test.tsx`\n  - `listbox.test.tsx`\n  - `button.test.tsx`\n  - `link.test.tsx`\n\n**Error and Performance Analysis:**  \n- **Root Cause:**  \n  The issue arises because `onClick` behavior is inconsistent across devices (e.g., firing twice on mobile) and does not align with accessibility standards. Some components use outdated event-handling logic, leading to performance bottlenecks and increased complexity.\n- **Current Limitations:**  \n  - Redundant event listeners and outdated utilities in `React Aria`.\n  - Increased bundle size due to unnecessary dependencies.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Proposed Solution / Implementation Steps\n\n\n**Files to Create or Add:**  \n1. **New Files:**  \n   - **DeprecationWarnings.tsx**: A utility file for issuing deprecation warnings during development.\n   \n2. **Updated Files:**  \n   - `menu-item-base.tsx`  \n   - `use-menu-item.ts`  \n   - `listbox-item-base.tsx`  \n   - `use-listbox-item.ts`  \n   - `use-button.ts`  \n   - `use-link.ts`  \n   - Test files (`menu.test.tsx`, `listbox.test.tsx`, `button.test.tsx`, `link.test.tsx`).\n\n**High-Level Changes:**  \n1. Deprecate `onClick` in favor of `onPress` for all interactive components.\n2. Add mobile-specific handling to ensure compatibility with `onPress`.\n3. Remove unnecessary packages and update utilities from `React Aria` for performance improvements.\n\n**Specific Technical Steps:**  \n1. **Dependencies:**  \n   - Install the latest version of `@react-aria/interactions` to handle `onPress`.\n   - Remove unused dependencies like `@nextui-org/use-aria-menu` and `@nextui-org/use-aria-toggle-button`.\n\n   ```bash\n   npm install @react-aria/interactions\n   npm uninstall @nextui-org/use-aria-menu @nextui-org/use-aria-toggle-button\n   ```\n\n2. **Event Refactoring:**  \n   - Update the `use-menu-item.ts` and `menu-item-base.tsx` components:\n     - Add a `handlePress` function to wrap both `onPress` and the deprecated `onClick` event, ensuring backward compatibility.\n     - Issue a deprecation warning when `onClick` is used.\n\n   ```typescript\n   const handlePress = (e: PressEvent) => {\n       if (deprecatedOnClick) {\n           warn(\"onClick is deprecated, please use onPress instead.\");\n           deprecatedOnClick(e as React.MouseEvent);\n       }\n       onPress?.(e);\n   };\n   ```\n\n   - Similar updates should be made for `use-listbox-item.ts`, `use-button.ts`, and `use-link.ts`.\n\n3. **Test Updates:**  \n   - Write unit tests to verify the functionality of both `onPress` and deprecated `onClick`.\n   - Ensure the tests cover edge cases like event propagation, mobile behavior, and accessibility compliance.\n\n4. **Bundle Optimization:**  \n   - Remove redundant dependencies and utilities (e.g., `@nextui-org/use-aria-menu`).\n   - Update imports in affected files to use the optimized utilities from `React Aria`.\n\n5. **Backward Compatibility:**  \n   - Make `onClick` support optional and log deprecation warnings when used.\n   - Document the migration path for developers: replace `onClick` with `onPress`.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Post-Fix / Post-Implementation Checks\n\n\n1. **Unit Tests:**  \n   - Update existing tests to check for the correct firing of `onPress` and backward compatibility with `onClick`.\n\n2. **Integration Testing:**  \n   - Ensure that all interactive components (`MenuItem`, `ListboxItem`, `Button`, and `Link`) behave consistently across devices and browsers.\n   - Verify that `onPress` handles events correctly and that `onClick` issues a warning without breaking functionality.\n\n3. **Performance Testing:**  \n   - Measure bundle size reduction after removing unused dependencies.\n   - Test rendering performance and interaction latency for updated components.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Documentation and Communication\n\n\n1. **Update Documentation:**  \n   - Add usage examples for `onPress` in the respective component documentation.\n   - Document the migration path from `onClick` to `onPress`.\n\n2. **Add Release Notes:**  \n   - In the project\u2019s `CHANGELOG`, include a summary of the updates:\n     - Deprecation of `onClick`.\n     - Introduction of `onPress`.\n     - Removal of unnecessary dependencies.\n\n3. **Inline Comments:**  \n   - Add comments in updated files explaining the changes, e.g., why `onClick` was deprecated and how `onPress` improves accessibility.",
