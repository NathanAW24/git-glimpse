hi bro
can just run index.py
dont forget to set up env first using the readme in the root folder.

once you have index the vector db ONCE right
subsequently you can just use the already-indexed DB.

I have put comments, you can toggle the boolean USE_LOCAL_DB in the code.
*alternative you can ask chatgpt :)
