Description:
üìù Description

introduce a new canary branch (all PRs should be merged into this branch instead)
canary branch will be set as a default branch
users can install dev packages from the code in canary branch
keep a snapshot of the latest published code in main branch
docs & storybook deployment remain unchanged (i.e. merging to canary won't deploy them to production. only deploy when pushing to main.)

Git Flow for general changes:

branch out from canary, says feat/foo
make some changes, then make a PR to canary
when the PR is approved and merged, it will

create canary release &
create / update the release PR (changeset-release/canary -> canary)

if we merge this PR, it will publish the corresponding packages to NPM (i.e. publish to production)
automatically trigger sync_canary_to_main to sync all the changes to main branch





Git Flow for Docs / Storybook Urgent Changes:

branch out from canary, says docs/urgent-foo
make some changes, then make a PR to main
sync back to canary after merged

## Walkthrough
The recent updates streamline development activities by shifting the primary branch from `main` to `canary`. This transition impacts various configurations and workflows to align with the new branch structure. Notably, workflows are now tailored to synchronize changes between the `canary` and `main` branches, enhancing the development and release processes.

## Changes

| Files                          | Change Summary |
|--------------------------------|----------------|
| `.changeset/config.json`<br>`.github/workflows/QA.yaml`<br>`.coderabbit.yaml` | Updated base branches and trigger branches from `main` to `canary`. |
| `.github/workflows/release.yaml` | Adjusted branch references for workflow triggers and enhanced release process for `canary` and `main` branches. |
| `.github/workflows/sync-develop-to-main.yaml`<br>`.github/workflows/sync-canary-to-main.yaml` | Introduced workflows to automate synchronization from `develop`/`canary` to `main`, creating PRs for review. |
| `CONTRIBUTING.md`              | Directed development efforts to `canary`, updated branch naming conventions, and PR guidelines accordingly. |
| `package.json`                 | Updated versioning and releasing scripts to use `canary` instead of `dev-v2`. |

<!-- walkthrough_end --><!-- This is an auto-generated comment: raw summary by coderabbit.ai -->
<!--


.changeset/config.json: The change in functionality involves switching the `baseBranch` value from `"main"` to `"canary"` in the configuration file.

---

.coderabbit.yaml: The change in functionality involves updating the base branches configuration in the `reviews` section of the `.coderabbit.yaml` file. Specifically, the `develop` branch has been replaced with `canary`.

---

.github/workflows/QA.yaml: The change in functionality for the `.github/workflows/QA.yaml` file involves switching the trigger branch from `main` to `canary`.

---

.github/workflows/release.yaml: The change in functionality involves adjusting the branch references for triggering workflows and modifying the release process to differentiate between canary and main branches. Specifically, the workflow now syncs files from the canary to the main branch upon a publish event and creates releases accordingly.

---

.github/workflows/sync-develop-to-main.yaml: This new file introduces a GitHub Actions workflow named "Sync Develop to Main" that automates the synchronization of changes from the Develop branch to the Main branch. It creates a pull request with detailed information about the changes and prompts for review and merging.

---

.github/workflows/sync-canary-to-main.yaml: This new file, `sync-canary-to-main.yaml`, introduces a GitHub Actions workflow named "Sync Canary to Main" that automates the synchronization of changes from the Canary branch to the Main branch. It creates a pull request with detailed information about the changes and prompts for review and merging.

---

CONTRIBUTING.md: The main branch is now referred to as the latest production version instead of the latest stable version. Development is required to be done in dedicated branches and merged to the `canary` branch. The branch naming convention for creating new branches has been updated to start from the `canary` branch instead of the `main` branch. Additionally, the instructions for running tests and building have been adjusted to reflect the use of the `canary` branch instead of `main`. Pull requests are now to be sent to the `canary` branch for review and merging by maintainers.

---

package.json: The functionality change involves updating the scripts for versioning and releasing in the `package.json` file to use `canary` instead of `dev-v2`, affecting the `version:canary` and `release:canary` scripts.

### PR Objectives

This pull request aims to implement a new Git workflow by introducing a `canary` branch as the default branch for development activities. The key objectives include:

1. **Branch Structure**:
   - Creation of the `canary` branch to receive all PRs and development changes.
   - Designation of the `main` branch to hold the latest published code for production.

2. **Development Process**:
   - Developers branch out from `canary` for general changes and create PRs to `canary`.
   - Approval and merging of PRs trigger canary releases and update release PRs for NPM package publication.
   - Automatic synchronization of changes from `canary` to `main` through the `sync_canary_to_main` process.

3. **Urgent Changes**:
   - For urgent documentation or Storybook updates, branching from `canary` to `main` is allowed, followed by synchronization back to `canary`.

4. **Deployment Strategy**:
   - Documentation and Storybook deployments remain tied to pushes to the `main` branch for production releases.

These changes aim to enhance development efficiency, streamline release processes, and maintain a clear separation between development and production-ready code.

### AI-generated Summary of Generated Summaries

The PR introduces a new Git workflow by establishing the `canary` branch as the focal point for development activities. Key changes include:

- **Workflow Adjustments**:
  - Updates in various files like `.coderabbit.yaml` and `.github/workflows` to switch base branches to `canary`, aligning with the new development strategy.

- **Synchronization Workflows**:
  - Introduction of `sync-develop-to-main.yaml` and `sync-canary-to-main.yaml` workflows to automate syncing changes from `develop` and `canary` branches to `main`, ensuring production branch consistency.

- **Documentation Updates**:
  - `CONTRIBUTING.md` revisions emphasize branching from `canary` for development, reflecting the shift from `main` as the default branch.

These changes support a structured release process, enabling continuous development on `canary` while maintaining a stable `main` branch for production releases.

<summary>Tips</summary>

### Chat

There are 3 ways to chat with [CodeRabbit](https://coderabbit.ai):

- Review comments: Directly reply to a review comment made by CodeRabbit. Example:
	- `I pushed a fix in commit <commit_id>.`
	- `Generate unit testing code for this file.`
	- `Open a follow-up GitHub issue for this discussion.`
- Files and specific lines of code (under the "Files changed" tab): Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new review comment at the desired location with your query. Examples:
	- `@coderabbitai generate unit testing code for this file.`
	-	`@coderabbitai modularize this function.`
- PR comments: Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new PR comment to ask questions about the PR branch. For the best results, please provide a very specific query, as very limited context is provided in this mode. Examples:
	- `@coderabbitai generate interesting stats about this repository and render them as a table.`
	- `@coderabbitai show all the console.log statements in this repository.`
	- `@coderabbitai read src/utils.ts and generate unit testing code.`
	- `@coderabbitai read the files in the src/scheduler package and generate a class diagram using mermaid and a README in the markdown format.`

Note: Be mindful of the bot's finite context window. It's strongly recommended to break down tasks such as reading entire modules into smaller chunks. For a focused discussion, use review comments to chat about specific files and their changes, instead of using the PR comments.

### CodeRabbit Commands (invoked as PR comments)

- `@coderabbitai pause` to pause the reviews on a PR.
- `@coderabbitai resume` to resume the paused reviews.
- `@coderabbitai review` to trigger a review. This is useful when automatic reviews are disabled for the repository.
- `@coderabbitai resolve` resolve all the CodeRabbit review comments.
- `@coderabbitai help` to get help.


Additionally, you can add `@coderabbitai ignore` anywhere in the PR description to prevent this PR from being reviewed.

### CodeRabbit Configration File (`.coderabbit.yaml`)

- You can programmatically configure CodeRabbit by adding a `.coderabbit.yaml` file to the root of your repository.
- Please see the [configuration documentation](https://docs.coderabbit.ai/guides/configure-coderabbit) for more information.
- If your editor has YAML language server enabled, you can add the path at the top of this file to enable auto-completion and validation: `# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://coderabbit.ai/integrations/schema.v2.json`
