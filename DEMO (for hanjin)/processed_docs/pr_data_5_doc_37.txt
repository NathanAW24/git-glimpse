apps/docs/content/docs/guide/installation.mdx: ## AI-generated summary of changes

The diff introduces significant structural changes to the installation guide for the NextUI project. It replaces a simple command-line installation instruction with a more comprehensive and organized format that enhances clarity and usability. The previous single command for installing the NextUI CLI via npm has been transformed into a section titled "Installation," which now includes a `<PackageManagers>` component. This component presents installation commands for multiple package managers (npm, yarn, pnpm, bun) in a structured manner, allowing users to choose their preferred method easily.

Additionally, the guide has been restructured to include new headings such as "Initialization and Starting the App" and "Adding the Components," which provide clearer navigation and context for users. The initialization command for creating a new NextUI app is retained but is now placed under its own section, emphasizing its importance. The overall flow of the document has been improved, making it more user-friendly and accessible for new users setting up their NextUI projects.

The changes also include the addition of a `<Steps>` component that encapsulates the installation and initialization instructions, further enhancing the visual organization of the content. This restructuring not only improves the readability of the guide but also aligns it with best practices for documentation.

Overall, the modifications enhance the functionality and clarity of the installation guide, making it easier for users to follow the steps necessary to set up their NextUI projects.

## PR summary

The pull request titled "docs(installation): adding package manager options and stepifying the‚Ä¶" aims to enhance the installation documentation for the NextUI library. It addresses issue #3722 by incorporating additional package manager options beyond just npm for the installation process. The modifications include a structured approach to the automated installation instructions, breaking them down into clear, step-by-step guidelines to improve user comprehension. The PR includes visual comparisons of the current and new documentation layouts, demonstrating the changes made for better clarity. Importantly, the PR does not introduce any breaking changes to the existing functionality.

## Objectives from linked issues

The linked issue #3722 highlights a need for improved documentation regarding installation commands for the NextUI library. The primary objective is to expand the installation page to include commands for multiple package managers, similar to what is already available on the CLI documentation page. The issue points out that the current installation documentation predominantly features npm commands, which may limit accessibility for users who prefer other package managers. The proposed solution is to add tabs for various package managers, ensuring that users can easily find the relevant installation commands for their preferred tools. This enhancement aims to provide a more comprehensive and user-friendly experience for developers using NextUI.

### Chat

There are 3 ways to chat with [CodeRabbit](https://coderabbit.ai):

- Review comments: Directly reply to a review comment made by CodeRabbit. Example:
	- `I pushed a fix in commit <commit_id>.`
	- `Generate unit testing code for this file.`
	- `Open a follow-up GitHub issue for this discussion.`
- Files and specific lines of code (under the "Files changed" tab): Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new review comment at the desired location with your query. Examples:
	- `@coderabbitai generate unit testing code for this file.`
	-	`@coderabbitai modularize this function.`
- PR comments: Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new PR comment to ask questions about the PR branch. For the best results, please provide a very specific query, as very limited context is provided in this mode. Examples:
	- `@coderabbitai generate interesting stats about this repository and render them as a table.`
	- `@coderabbitai show all the console.log statements in this repository.`
	- `@coderabbitai read src/utils.ts and generate unit testing code.`
	- `@coderabbitai read the files in the src/scheduler package and generate a class diagram using mermaid and a README in the markdown format.`
	- `@coderabbitai help me debug CodeRabbit configuration file.`

Note: Be mindful of the bot's finite context window. It's strongly recommended to break down tasks such as reading entire modules into smaller chunks. For a focused discussion, use review comments to chat about specific files and their changes, instead of using the PR comments.

### CodeRabbit Commands (Invoked using PR comments)

- `@coderabbitai pause` to pause the reviews on a PR.
- `@coderabbitai resume` to resume the paused reviews.
- `@coderabbitai review` to trigger an incremental review. This is useful when automatic reviews are disabled for the repository.
- `@coderabbitai full review` to do a full review from scratch and review all the files again.
- `@coderabbitai summary` to regenerate the summary of the PR.
- `@coderabbitai resolve` resolve all the CodeRabbit review comments.
- `@coderabbitai configuration` to show the current CodeRabbit configuration for the repository.
- `@coderabbitai help` to get help.
