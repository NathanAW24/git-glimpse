### PR Objectives

This Pull Request (PR) focuses on adding Right-to-Left (RTL) support to the RadioGroup component in NextUI, specifically version 2.2.10. The current RadioGroup component lacks RTL support, leading to misalignment and display issues in RTL environments, notably impacting users of languages like Arabic. By addressing the RTL support deficiency, this PR aims to ensure correct rendering of the RadioGroup component in RTL layouts, improving usability and visual consistency across different language directions. The linked issue (#2507) highlights the existing bug related to RTL support in the RadioGroup component, emphasizing the need for this enhancement to rectify the display discrepancies observed in RTL mode.

### Comments Summary

- **khatabakhsh** requested reviews from specific team members, indicating the importance of their feedback for the PR.
- **khatabakhsh** added a changeset and mentioned team members for review.
- **khatabakhsh** sought reviews from @wingkwong and @jrgarciadev, expressing gratitude for their time and feedback.
- The PR includes improvements to the RadioGroup component's styling to accommodate RTL layouts, enhancing support for different screen sizes and RTL languages.
- The PR addresses a bug where the RadioGroup component did not display correctly in RTL mode, impacting usability in Arabic locales.
- Screenshots provided in the linked issue demonstrate the visual discrepancies in RadioGroup alignment between LTR and RTL directions.
- The PR aims to ensure consistent behavior across browsers, including Edge, by implementing RTL-specific styling adjustments in the RadioGroup component.

### AI-Generated Summary of Generated Summaries

The core change in this PR involves enhancing the RadioGroup component's styling to support RTL layouts effectively. By introducing RTL-specific styling (`rtl:mr-2 rtl:ml-[unset]`) alongside existing `ml-2` styling for various screen sizes, the PR ensures proper alignment and display in RTL environments. This adjustment aims to enhance the user experience for a wider audience, ensuring the UI behaves consistently in both LTR and RTL modes across major browsers. The PR's primary goal is to improve usability and accessibility by addressing RTL support deficiencies, making the RadioGroup component more inclusive and user-friendly for individuals interacting with applications in RTL languages.

### Chat

There are 3 ways to chat with [CodeRabbit](https://coderabbit.ai):

- Review comments: Directly reply to a review comment made by CodeRabbit. Example:
	- `I pushed a fix in commit <commit_id>.`
	- `Generate unit testing code for this file.`
	- `Open a follow-up GitHub issue for this discussion.`
- Files and specific lines of code (under the "Files changed" tab): Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new review comment at the desired location with your query. Examples:
	- `@coderabbitai generate unit testing code for this file.`
	-	`@coderabbitai modularize this function.`
- PR comments: Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new PR comment to ask questions about the PR branch. For the best results, please provide a very specific query, as very limited context is provided in this mode. Examples:
	- `@coderabbitai generate interesting stats about this repository and render them as a table.`
	- `@coderabbitai show all the console.log statements in this repository.`
	- `@coderabbitai read src/utils.ts and generate unit testing code.`
	- `@coderabbitai read the files in the src/scheduler package and generate a class diagram using mermaid and a README in the markdown format.`

Note: Be mindful of the bot's finite context window. It's strongly recommended to break down tasks such as reading entire modules into smaller chunks. For a focused discussion, use review comments to chat about specific files and their changes, instead of using the PR comments.

### CodeRabbit Commands (invoked as PR comments)

- `@coderabbitai pause` to pause the reviews on a PR.
- `@coderabbitai resume` to resume the paused reviews.
- `@coderabbitai review` to trigger a review. This is useful when automatic reviews are disabled for the repository.
- `@coderabbitai resolve` resolve all the CodeRabbit review comments.
- `@coderabbitai help` to get help.


Additionally, you can add `@coderabbitai ignore` anywhere in the PR description to prevent this PR from being reviewed.
