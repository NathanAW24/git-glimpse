## Walkthrough

The changes primarily address issues related to the `showMonthAndYearPickers` mode in the `@nextui-org/calendar` and `@nextui-org/date-picker` packages. A new conditional check was added to the `useCalendarPicker` function to prevent unnecessary scrolling. Additionally, new test cases were introduced to ensure the selected date remains unchanged when toggling the picker in the specified mode. These modifications enhance the stability and functionality of the date and calendar pickers.

### AI-generated summary of generated summaries

The recent changes primarily focus on enhancements and bug fixes for the `@nextui-org/calendar` and `@nextui-org/date-picker` packages. Key updates include:

1. **Calendar Component**:
   - **Conditional Check Addition**: In the `useCalendarPicker` function (`packages/components/calendar/src/use-calendar-picker.ts`), a conditional check `if (!isHeaderExpanded) return;` was added. This ensures that scrolling to the selected month/year only occurs when the header is expanded, improving the component's behavior during mount/open/close events.

2. **Date Picker Component**:
   - **Patch for Clearing Issues**: A new changeset file (`.changeset/tidy-squids-knock.md`) introduces a patch for both `@nextui-org/calendar` and `@nextui-org/date-picker` packages. This patch addresses issues related to clearing hours and months when the `showMonthAndYearPickers` mode is enabled.
   - **New Test Case**: In the `date-picker.test.tsx` file (`packages/components/date-picker/__tests__/date-picker.test.tsx`), a new test case was added. This test ensures that the selected date remains unchanged when the picker is toggled in `showMonthAndYearPickers` mode.

### Chat

There are 3 ways to chat with [CodeRabbit](https://coderabbit.ai):

- Review comments: Directly reply to a review comment made by CodeRabbit. Example:
	- `I pushed a fix in commit <commit_id>.`
	- `Generate unit testing code for this file.`
	- `Open a follow-up GitHub issue for this discussion.`
- Files and specific lines of code (under the "Files changed" tab): Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new review comment at the desired location with your query. Examples:
	- `@coderabbitai generate unit testing code for this file.`
	-	`@coderabbitai modularize this function.`
- PR comments: Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new PR comment to ask questions about the PR branch. For the best results, please provide a very specific query, as very limited context is provided in this mode. Examples:
	- `@coderabbitai generate interesting stats about this repository and render them as a table.`
	- `@coderabbitai show all the console.log statements in this repository.`
	- `@coderabbitai read src/utils.ts and generate unit testing code.`
	- `@coderabbitai read the files in the src/scheduler package and generate a class diagram using mermaid and a README in the markdown format.`

Note: Be mindful of the bot's finite context window. It's strongly recommended to break down tasks such as reading entire modules into smaller chunks. For a focused discussion, use review comments to chat about specific files and their changes, instead of using the PR comments.

### CodeRabbit Commands (invoked as PR comments)

- `@coderabbitai pause` to pause the reviews on a PR.
- `@coderabbitai resume` to resume the paused reviews.
- `@coderabbitai review` to trigger an incremental review. This is useful when automatic reviews are disabled for the repository.
- `@coderabbitai full review` to full the review from scratch and review all the files again.
- `@coderabbitai summary` to regenerate the summary of the PR.
- `@coderabbitai resolve` resolve all the CodeRabbit review comments.
- `@coderabbitai help` to get help.


Additionally, you can add `@coderabbitai ignore` anywhere in the PR description to prevent this PR from being reviewed.

### CodeRabbit Configration File (`.coderabbit.yaml`)

- You can programmatically configure CodeRabbit by adding a `.coderabbit.yaml` file to the root of your repository.
- Please see the [configuration documentation](https://docs.coderabbit.ai/guides/configure-coderabbit) for more information.
- If your editor has YAML language server enabled, you can add the path at the top of this file to enable auto-completion and validation: `# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://coderabbit.ai/integrations/schema.v2.json`
