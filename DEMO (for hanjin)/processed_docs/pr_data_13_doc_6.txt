## Walkthrough

The update includes the implementation of the `useMediaQuery` hook from the "usehooks-ts" library in the `cmdk.tsx` component. This hook is utilized to check if the screen width is under 650 pixels, allowing the component's width to dynamically adjust based on the screen size.

The description of the pull request details the current behavior where the cmdk menu shrinks undesirably under certain conditions. The proposed change introduces a minimum width to the cmdk menu to prevent this issue, ensuring a consistent user experience across different scenarios. The change is confirmed to be non-breaking, meaning it should not disrupt existing functionalities or require users to make adjustments on their end.

### AI-Generated Summary of Generated Summaries

The code changes in the pull request involve the use of the `useMediaQuery` hook from the "usehooks-ts" library within the `cmdk.tsx` file. This hook is utilized to check if the screen width is below 650 pixels. Based on this condition, the width of the cmdk menu component is dynamically adjusted. This implementation ensures that the cmdk menu maintains a minimum width, preventing it from appearing too small on narrower screens. This adjustment aligns with the objective of enhancing the visual consistency and usability of the cmdk menu across different device sizes.

`18-18`: Import of `useMediaQuery` from "usehooks-ts" is correctly added to support responsive design adjustments.

> This review was outside the diff hunks and was mapped to the diff hunk with the greatest overlap. Original lines [141-375]

The implementation of `useMediaQuery` to adjust the modal width based on screen size is correctly done. The conditional rendering logic at line 375 ensures that the modal width is set to 320px on mobile devices (width <= 650px) and 580px on larger screens. This change aligns with the PR's objective to enhance the cmdk menu's usability across different device sizes.

### Chat

There are 3 ways to chat with [CodeRabbit](https://coderabbit.ai):

- Review comments: Directly reply to a review comment made by CodeRabbit. Example:
	- `I pushed a fix in commit <commit_id>.`
	- `Generate unit testing code for this file.`
	- `Open a follow-up GitHub issue for this discussion.`
- Files and specific lines of code (under the "Files changed" tab): Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new review comment at the desired location with your query. Examples:
	- `@coderabbitai generate unit testing code for this file.`
	-	`@coderabbitai modularize this function.`
- PR comments: Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new PR comment to ask questions about the PR branch. For the best results, please provide a very specific query, as very limited context is provided in this mode. Examples:
	- `@coderabbitai generate interesting stats about this repository and render them as a table.`
	- `@coderabbitai show all the console.log statements in this repository.`
	- `@coderabbitai read src/utils.ts and generate unit testing code.`
	- `@coderabbitai read the files in the src/scheduler package and generate a class diagram using mermaid and a README in the markdown format.`

Note: Be mindful of the bot's finite context window. It's strongly recommended to break down tasks such as reading entire modules into smaller chunks. For a focused discussion, use review comments to chat about specific files and their changes, instead of using the PR comments.

### CodeRabbit Commands (invoked as PR comments)

- `@coderabbitai pause` to pause the reviews on a PR.
- `@coderabbitai resume` to resume the paused reviews.
- `@coderabbitai review` to trigger a review. This is useful when automatic reviews are disabled for the repository.
- `@coderabbitai resolve` resolve all the CodeRabbit review comments.
- `@coderabbitai help` to get help.


Additionally, you can add `@coderabbitai ignore` anywhere in the PR description to prevent this PR from being reviewed.
