<!-- walkthrough_start -->

## Walkthrough
The updates primarily focus on refining component imports, simplifying props in icon components, and enhancing data fetching mechanisms across various components like tables and selects. Changes also include the removal of `asIframe` properties to alter the rendering of code demos. These modifications aim to streamline codebases, improve readability, and optimize data handling processes.

## Changes

| File Path | Change Summary |
|-----------|----------------|
| `.../code-demo/react-live-demo.tsx` | Added imports for hooks `useInfiniteScroll` and `useAsyncList`. |
| `.../navbar/with-dropdown-menu.ts` | Simplified icon components by removing redundant props and updating usage. |
| `.../select/async-loading-items.ts` | Refactored to enhance state management and dynamic item handling in `Select` component. |
| `.../table/async-pagination.ts` <br> `.../table/infinite-pagination.ts` <br> `.../table/load-more.ts` <br> `.../table/sorting.ts` | Updated data fetching and pagination logic in table components using improved async functions and state management. |
| `.../table/custom-styles.ts` <br> `.../table/use-case.ts` | Consolidated imports and streamlined dependencies in table components. |
| `.../docs/components/modal.mdx` | Adjusted modal example preview height. |
| `.../docs/components/navbar.mdx` <br> `.../docs/components/select.mdx` <br> `.../docs/components/table.mdx` | Removed `asIframe` from `CodeDemo` components, affecting rendering in documentation.

<!-- walkthrough_end --><!-- This is an auto-generated comment: raw summary by coderabbit.ai -->

<!--

apps/docs/components/docs/components/code-demo/react-live-demo.tsx: Added imports for `useInfiniteScroll` from `@nextui-org/use-infinite-scroll` and `useAsyncList` from `@react-stately/data`.

---

apps/docs/content/components/navbar/with-dropdown-menu.ts: Refactored exported icon components by removing props like `fill`, `size`, `height`, and `width` from their declarations and setting fixed values directly in the components. Replaced the `Icons` constant with individual icon components like `ChevronDown`, `Lock`, `Activity`, `Flash`, `Server`, `TagUser`, and `Scale`, each defined with simplified props. Updated the `App` component to import and use these updated icon components without explicit prop assignments.

---

apps/docs/content/components/select/async-loading-items.ts: Refactored code structure and functionality. Exported a `Pokemon` type directly, updated the component logic within the `App` function, and modified the use of hooks like `useInfiniteScroll`. Replaced the `usePokemonList` function with `App` as the default export, with adjustments to state management and data loading. Updated rendering of the `Select` component to handle Pokemon items dynamically.

---

apps/docs/content/components/table/async-pagination.ts: Updated the `App` component to manage data fetching and loading state internally using `React.useState` and `React.useEffect`. Fetches data from a specific API endpoint based on the current page, updates data and loading state accordingly, and displays fetched data in a table with pagination support. Revised logic for calculating the number of pages and handling loading states.

---

apps/docs/content/components/table/custom-styles.ts: Consolidated imports of various components and removed unnecessary dependencies. Imports components directly without line breaks, simplifying import statements. Removed dependencies for `Selection`, `ChipProps`, and `SortDescriptor` from imports.

---

apps/docs/content/components/table/infinite-pagination.ts: Modified the `load` function within the `useAsyncList` hook to include an inner asynchronous function `fetchData` that handles data fetching and processing. Adjusted logic for setting loading state and determining pagination.

---

apps/docs/content/components/table/load-more.ts: Modified the `load` function within the `useAsyncList` hook to include asynchronous data fetching logic using `fetch` and `await`. Checks for the presence of a cursor, increments the page number if a cursor exists, fetches data from the specified URL or a default URL, updates loading state, and returns fetched data along with the cursor for pagination.

---

apps/docs/content/components/table/sorting.ts: Restructured asynchronous data fetching process within the `load` function by introducing an inner async function `fetchData` to handle data retrieval and setting loading state.

---

apps/docs/content/components/table/use-case.ts: Consolidated imports of various components into a single line, removed unnecessary line breaks, and adjusted dependencies array in `useMemo` hooks for better readability and maintainability.

---

apps/docs/content/docs/components/modal.mdx: Adjusted the preview height of the modal placement example in the code snippet.

---

apps/docs/content/docs/components/navbar.mdx: Removed `asIframe` and `iframeSrc` attributes from `CodeDemo` components across various sections. Adjusted highlighted lines for specific examples to better focus on relevant code segments.

---

apps/docs/content/docs/components/select.mdx: Removed the `asIframe` prop from the `CodeDemo` component, affecting how the component is rendered.

---

apps/docs/content/docs/components/table.mdx: Removed the `asIframe` prop from multiple `CodeDemo` components, affecting the display of examples related to sorting, loading more data, async pagination, infinite pagination, use case example, and custom styles.

<summary>Tips</summary>

### Chat

There are 3 ways to chat with [CodeRabbit](https://coderabbit.ai):

- Review comments: Directly reply to a review comment made by CodeRabbit. Example:
	- `I pushed a fix in commit <commit_id>.`
	- `Generate unit testing code for this file.`
	- `Open a follow-up GitHub issue for this discussion.`
- Files and specific lines of code (under the "Files changed" tab): Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new review comment at the desired location with your query. Examples:
	- `@coderabbitai generate unit testing code for this file.`
	-	`@coderabbitai modularize this function.`
- PR comments: Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new PR comment to ask questions about the PR branch. For the best results, please provide a very specific query, as very limited context is provided in this mode. Examples:
	- `@coderabbitai generate interesting stats about this repository and render them as a table.`
	- `@coderabbitai show all the console.log statements in this repository.`
	- `@coderabbitai read src/utils.ts and generate unit testing code.`
	- `@coderabbitai read the files in the src/scheduler package and generate a class diagram using mermaid and a README in the markdown format.`
	- `@coderabbitai help me debug CodeRabbit configuration file.`

Note: Be mindful of the bot's finite context window. It's strongly recommended to break down tasks such as reading entire modules into smaller chunks. For a focused discussion, use review comments to chat about specific files and their changes, instead of using the PR comments.

### CodeRabbit Commands (invoked as PR comments)

- `@coderabbitai summary` to regenerate the summary of the PR.
- `@coderabbitai resolve` resolve all the CodeRabbit review comments.
- `@coderabbitai configuration` to show the current CodeRabbit configuration for the repository.
- `@coderabbitai help` to get help.


Additionally, you can add `@coderabbitai ignore` anywhere in the PR description to prevent this PR from being reviewed.

Having an iframe + resizer is important for components like Navbar / Modal Placement / Etc.. \n- jrgarciadev: @kuri-sun \n- kuri-sun: @jrgarciadev That's way better approach.
