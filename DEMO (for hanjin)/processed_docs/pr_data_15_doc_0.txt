### PR Objectives

This Pull Request (PR) titled "fix(disabled table rows): fixed cursor for disabled rows in Table" (PR #2502) aims to enhance user experience by addressing an issue in the Table component. The primary goal is to improve clarity for users interacting with disabled rows by changing the cursor style from normal to `cursor-not-allowed`. By making this adjustment, users will clearly see which rows are disabled and non-interactive within the Table.

The PR description outlines the problem, solution, and impact of the change. It references the related issue #2501, which reported the bug of disabled rows showing a normal cursor instead of the expected `cursor-not-allowed`. The PR seeks to rectify this discrepancy to align with user expectations and improve the overall usability of the Table component.

### AI-generated Summary of Generated Summaries

This PR introduces a crucial update to the "@nextui-org/table" package, focusing on enhancing the styling of disabled rows within the Table component. The key change involves switching the cursor style for disabled rows from the default cursor to `cursor-not-allowed`, improving visual feedback for users. The modification is captured in a new changeset file and the `table.ts` component file in the core theme package. The changeset file signifies a major version update for the package, emphasizing the significance of the fix. By directly implementing the cursor style change in the `table.ts` file, disabled rows now clearly indicate their non-interactive state, aligning with user expectations and addressing the issue raised in #2501. This adjustment aims to enhance user experience by providing more intuitive visual cues within the Table component.

### Chat

There are 3 ways to chat with CodeRabbit:

- Review comments: Directly reply to a review comment made by CodeRabbit. Example:
	- `I pushed a fix in commit <commit_id>.`
	- `Generate unit-tests for this file.`
	- `Open a follow-up GitHub issue for this discussion.`
- Files and specific lines of code (under the "Files changed" tab): Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new review comment at the desired location with your query. Examples:
	- `@coderabbitai generate unit tests for this file.`
	-	`@coderabbitai modularize this function.`
- PR comments: Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new PR comment to ask questions about the PR branch. For the best results, please provide a very specific query, as very limited context is provided in this mode. Examples:
	- `@coderabbitai generate interesting stats about this repository and render them as a table.`
	- `@coderabbitai show all the console.log statements in this repository.`
	- `@coderabbitai read src/utils.ts and generate unit tests.`
	- `@coderabbitai read the files in the src/scheduler package and generate a class diagram using mermaid and a README in the markdown format.`

Note: Be mindful of the bot's finite context window. It's strongly recommended to break down tasks such as reading entire modules into smaller chunks. For a focused discussion, use review comments to chat about specific files and their changes, instead of using the PR comments.
