Comments:
- jrgarciadev: Hey, @krystofex thank you for adding this, however, there are some drawbacks in adding Gitpod to the project, here are some of them:

1. It's a paid service
2. The idea it's to work locally
3.  storybook-static can't be ignore because it's the folder that it's uploaded to vercel after build

Thanks!\n
