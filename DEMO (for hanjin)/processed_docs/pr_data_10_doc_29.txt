Description:
üìù Description

Fixed a type error in the onKeyDown event handler for the menu component.

‚õ≥Ô∏è Current behavior (updates)

The current implementation uses @ts-ignore to suppress type errors in the onKeyDown event handler. This may result in reduced type safety.

üöÄ New behavior

Replaced @ts-ignore with the appropriate type annotation for the onKeyDown event handler. The handler now ensures type safety by checking if listProps.onKeyDown is defined before calling it.

üí£ Is this a breaking change (Yes/No):

No


Summary by CodeRabbit

Refactor

Enhanced type safety for keyboard event handling in the menu component.

## Walkthrough

The recent update to the `use-aria-menu` package aims to enhance type definitions for improved clarity and type safety. It involves refining event handling within the `useMenu` function by importing `ReactKeyboardEvent` from React and updating the `onKeyDown` function signature to use `ReactKeyboardEvent<HTMLElement>`. These changes contribute to better code readability and maintainability.

### AI-generated summary of generated summaries

The `use-menu.ts` file in the `use-aria-menu` package has been updated to enhance type safety and clarity in handling keyboard events. The changes involve importing `ReactKeyboardEvent` from `"react"` and updating the `onKeyDown` function signature within the `useMenu` function to use `ReactKeyboardEvent<HTMLElement>` instead of a generic `e` parameter. By explicitly typing the event parameter, the codebase now ensures more precise event handling aligned with React's event system, improving overall code quality and maintainability. Additionally, a patch in `real-turkeys-sparkle.md` for `@nextui-org/use-aria-menu` addresses a type error in the `onKeyDown` event handler for the menu component, ensuring better type safety and correctness in event handling.

### Alterations to the declarations of exported or public entities

#### `use-menu.ts`:
- **Before Changes**:
```typescript
import { RefObject } from "react";

// Inside useMenu function
onKeyDown: (e) => {
  // function implementation
}
```

- **After Changes**:
```typescript
import { RefObject, KeyboardEvent as ReactKeyboardEvent } from "react";

// Inside useMenu function
onKeyDown: (event: ReactKeyboardEvent<HTMLElement>) => {
  // function implementation
}
```

#### `real-turkeys-sparkle.md`:
- **No alterations to the declarations of exported or public entities.**

### Chat

There are 3 ways to chat with [CodeRabbit](https://coderabbit.ai):

- Review comments: Directly reply to a review comment made by CodeRabbit. Example:
	- `I pushed a fix in commit <commit_id>.`
	- `Generate unit testing code for this file.`
	- `Open a follow-up GitHub issue for this discussion.`
- Files and specific lines of code (under the "Files changed" tab): Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new review comment at the desired location with your query. Examples:
	- `@coderabbitai generate unit testing code for this file.`
	-	`@coderabbitai modularize this function.`
- PR comments: Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new PR comment to ask questions about the PR branch. For the best results, please provide a very specific query, as very limited context is provided in this mode. Examples:
	- `@coderabbitai generate interesting stats about this repository and render them as a table.`
	- `@coderabbitai show all the console.log statements in this repository.`
	- `@coderabbitai read src/utils.ts and generate unit testing code.`
	- `@coderabbitai read the files in the src/scheduler package and generate a class diagram using mermaid and a README in the markdown format.`

Note: Be mindful of the bot's finite context window. It's strongly recommended to break down tasks such as reading entire modules into smaller chunks. For a focused discussion, use review comments to chat about specific files and their changes, instead of using the PR comments.

### CodeRabbit Commands (invoked as PR comments)

- `@coderabbitai pause` to pause the reviews on a PR.
- `@coderabbitai resume` to resume the paused reviews.
- `@coderabbitai review` to trigger a review. This is useful when automatic reviews are disabled for the repository.
- `@coderabbitai resolve` resolve all the CodeRabbit review comments.
- `@coderabbitai help` to get help.


Additionally, you can add `@coderabbitai ignore` anywhere in the PR description to prevent this PR from being reviewed.

### CodeRabbit Configration File (`.coderabbit.yaml`)

- You can programmatically configure CodeRabbit by adding a `.coderabbit.yaml` file to the root of your repository.
- Please see the [configuration documentation](https://docs.coderabbit.ai/guides/configure-coderabbit) for more information.
- If your editor has YAML language server enabled, you can add the path at the top of this file to enable auto-completion and validation: `# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://coderabbit.ai/integrations/schema.v2.json`
