Title: fix(input): keep input component's position in innerWrapper steady
Base Branch: main
Head Branch: fix/input-position
Author: black197
URL: https://github.com/nextui-org/nextui/pull/2072

Description:
Closes #2069  
📝 Description
When startContent or endContent becomes truthy, it will change the position of <input /> and React will re-mount <input />. This makes it losing focus. So we can remove the condition and just let startContent or endContent be in innerWrapper to make the position of <input /> steady.
⛳️ Current behavior (updates)
When endContent becomes truthy while user focusing input, input will lose focus.
🚀 New behavior
Now input won't lose focus.
💣 Is this a breaking change (Yes/No): No

Sorry, I was wrong. The needed authorization is used for deploying docs, not related to the code changes.

@jrgarciadev Mind taking a look when you are free? When I want to control the loading state with a `CircularProgress` in `endContent`, this error causes me to lose focus on the input. Thank you very much for your work, also @black197. 👍🏼\n- g1eny0ung: HI @jrgarciadev, I noticed that you may busy recently and haven't updated this repository for the past three weeks. I was wondering if you would be open to contributions. If yes, I would be happy to assist with any issues, including reviewing pull requests. My project depends on the next UI, so I would like to help resolve any issues with it quickly.\n
