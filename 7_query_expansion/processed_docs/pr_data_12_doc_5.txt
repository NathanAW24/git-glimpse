### PR Objectives

The pull request titled "fix: add missing react-dom peer dependency to @nextui-org/use-aria-menu" with number 2827 addresses a dependency issue in the `@nextui-org/use-aria-menu` package. The error stemmed from `@react-aria/selection` attempting to access `react-dom`, which was not provided by its ancestors, causing ambiguity in the require call. By adding `react-dom` as a peer dependency in the `package.json` of `@nextui-org/use-aria-menu`, this PR resolves the dependency chain problem, enabling successful builds in a Plug'n'Play environment without disrupting existing functionality.

### AI-Generated Summary of Changes

The PR modifies the `package.json` of `@nextui-org/use-aria-menu` by including `"react-dom": ">=18"` as a peer dependency alongside the existing `"react": ">=18"`. This addition ensures that both `react` and `react-dom` are mandatory dependencies for projects utilizing this package. By making this adjustment, the PR rectifies the dependency issue that hindered the NextUI project's build process under a Plug'n'Play environment, facilitating smoother development workflows.

### Chat

There are 3 ways to chat with [CodeRabbit](https://coderabbit.ai):

- Review comments: Directly reply to a review comment made by CodeRabbit. Example:
	- `I pushed a fix in commit <commit_id>.`
	- `Generate unit testing code for this file.`
	- `Open a follow-up GitHub issue for this discussion.`
- Files and specific lines of code (under the "Files changed" tab): Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new review comment at the desired location with your query. Examples:
	- `@coderabbitai generate unit testing code for this file.`
	-	`@coderabbitai modularize this function.`
- PR comments: Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new PR comment to ask questions about the PR branch. For the best results, please provide a very specific query, as very limited context is provided in this mode. Examples:
	- `@coderabbitai generate interesting stats about this repository and render them as a table.`
	- `@coderabbitai show all the console.log statements in this repository.`
	- `@coderabbitai read src/utils.ts and generate unit testing code.`
	- `@coderabbitai read the files in the src/scheduler package and generate a class diagram using mermaid and a README in the markdown format.`

Note: Be mindful of the bot's finite context window. It's strongly recommended to break down tasks such as reading entire modules into smaller chunks. For a focused discussion, use review comments to chat about specific files and their changes, instead of using the PR comments.

### CodeRabbit Commands (invoked as PR comments)

- `@coderabbitai pause` to pause the reviews on a PR.
- `@coderabbitai resume` to resume the paused reviews.
- `@coderabbitai review` to trigger a review. This is useful when automatic reviews are disabled for the repository.
- `@coderabbitai resolve` resolve all the CodeRabbit review comments.
- `@coderabbitai help` to get help.


Additionally, you can add `@coderabbitai ignore` anywhere in the PR description to prevent this PR from being reviewed.

### CodeRabbit Configration File (`.coderabbit.yaml`)

- You can programmatically configure CodeRabbit by adding a `.coderabbit.yaml` file to the root of your repository.
- Please see the [configuration documentation](https://docs.coderabbit.ai/guides/configure-coderabbit) for more information.
- If your editor has YAML language server enabled, you can add the path at the top of this file to enable auto-completion and validation: `# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://coderabbit.ai/integrations/schema.v2.json`
