### PR Objectives

This Pull Request (PR) titled "fix(navbar): lazy motion forwardRef issue" with the number 2527 aims to address a specific bug identified in issue #2521, which affects the NextUI documentation's sidebar scrollability on mobile devices. The core problem is that the sidebar, crucial for navigation within the NextUI docs, does not scroll on mobile platforms. This issue significantly hampers user experience, making it difficult for users to navigate through the documentation on smaller screens.

The bug's root cause has been traced back to the code snippet within `/nextui/packages/components/navbar/src/navbar-menu.tsx`, specifically involving the `RemoveScroll` component's usage within the `MenuWrapper` component. The proposed solution involves modifying the `MenuWrapper` component to enable sidebar scrolling on mobile devices. This modification is expected to rectify the scrolling issue, thereby improving the usability of the NextUI documentation on mobile browsers like Chrome.

The PR description, while brief, outlines the intention to fix the mentioned bug without introducing breaking changes. It suggests a change in the rendering order of the `LazyMotion` and `MenuWrapper` components within the `NavbarMenu` component. This adjustment is anticipated to affect the animation behavior, potentially resolving the scrolling issue without negatively impacting other functionalities.

Additionally, a changeset file (`dirty-beans-repair.md`) is introduced, indicating a patch for "@nextui-org/navbar" that specifically addresses the LazyMotion ForwardRef issue. This patch is part of the broader effort to enhance the NextUI library's compatibility and functionality across different devices, focusing on mobile user experience improvements.

In summary, the PR's objective is to fix a critical usability issue affecting mobile users of the NextUI documentation by making necessary adjustments to the navbar component's structure and behavior. This fix is expected to enable smooth scrolling of the sidebar on mobile devices, thereby significantly improving the accessibility and navigability of the NextUI docs for a wider audience.

### AI-generated Summary of Generated Summaries

The Pull Request introduces a targeted fix to the NextUI library, specifically addressing an issue with the navbar component that prevented the sidebar from scrolling on mobile devices. The solution involves a strategic modification within the `navbar-menu.tsx` file, where the rendering order of the `LazyMotion` and `MenuWrapper` components is adjusted. This change is aimed at correcting the animation behavior that contributed to the scrolling issue, thereby enhancing the mobile user experience for NextUI documentation.

Furthermore, the PR includes a changeset file named `dirty-beans-repair.md`, which documents a patch for the "@nextui-org/navbar" package. This patch is directly related to fixing the LazyMotion ForwardRef issue, signifying a focused effort to improve component compatibility and functionality across various platforms, with a particular emphasis on mobile usability.

Overall, the PR represents a concise yet impactful intervention in the NextUI library, aiming to resolve a specific user experience flaw without introducing any breaking changes. By reordering component rendering and applying a targeted patch, the PR seeks to ensure that the NextUI documentation sidebar becomes fully scrollable on mobile devices, thereby facilitating better access and navigation for users on the go.

### Chat

There are 3 ways to chat with CodeRabbit:

- Review comments: Directly reply to a review comment made by CodeRabbit. Example:
	- `I pushed a fix in commit <commit_id>.`
	- `Generate unit-tests for this file.`
	- `Open a follow-up GitHub issue for this discussion.`
- Files and specific lines of code (under the "Files changed" tab): Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new review comment at the desired location with your query. Examples:
	- `@coderabbitai generate unit tests for this file.`
	-	`@coderabbitai modularize this function.`
- PR comments: Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new PR comment to ask questions about the PR branch. For the best results, please provide a very specific query, as very limited context is provided in this mode. Examples:
	- `@coderabbitai generate interesting stats about this repository and render them as a table.`
	- `@coderabbitai show all the console.log statements in this repository.`
	- `@coderabbitai read src/utils.ts and generate unit tests.`
	- `@coderabbitai read the files in the src/scheduler package and generate a class diagram using mermaid and a README in the markdown format.`

Note: Be mindful of the bot's finite context window. It's strongly recommended to break down tasks such as reading entire modules into smaller chunks. For a focused discussion, use review comments to chat about specific files and their changes, instead of using the PR comments.
