## Walkthrough

The recent changes enhance the NextUI documentation by replacing inline code blocks with a new `PackageManagers` component. This component structures commands for various package managers (npm, yarn, pnpm, bun) for installing dependencies and starting the local server, improving readability, maintainability, and user experience.

```
apps/docs/content/docs/guide/cli.mdx: ## AI-generated summary of changes

The changes in this diff primarily involve the replacement of inline code blocks with a new `PackageManagers` component, which organizes and presents package manager commands in a more structured format. Specifically, the commands for using the CLI without global installation and for installing dependencies have been reformatted. The previous inline bash commands have been removed and replaced with the `PackageManagers` component, which accepts an object of commands for various package managers (npm, yarn, pnpm, and bun). This change enhances readability and maintainability by centralizing command definitions and potentially allowing for easier updates in the future.

Additionally, the command for starting the local server has also been updated to utilize the `PackageManagers` component, following the same format as the previous commands. This consistent approach across the documentation improves the overall user experience by providing a uniform method for displaying commands.

Overall, the modifications enhance the documentation's clarity and usability without altering the underlying functionality or logic.

## Alterations to the declarations of exported or public entities

- `commands` prop in `PackageManagers` component now includes:
  - For CLI usage: 
    - `npm: "npx nextui-cli@latest"`
    - `yarn: "yarn dlx nextui-cli@latest"`
    - `pnpm: "pnpm dlx nextui-cli@latest"`
    - `bun: "bunx nextui-cli@latest"`
  - For installing dependencies:
    - `npm: "cd my-nextui-app && npm install"`
    - `yarn: "cd my-nextui-app && yarn install"`
    - `pnpm: "cd my-nextui-app && pnpm install"`
    - `bun: "cd my-nextui-app && bun install"`
  - For starting the local server:
    - `npm: "npm run dev"`
    - `yarn: "yarn run dev"`
    - `pnpm: "pnpm run dev"`
    - `bun: "bun run dev"`

apps/docs/content/docs/guide/installation.mdx: ## AI-generated summary of changes

The changes in this diff primarily involve the modification of code blocks for installing dependencies and starting the local server in the documentation for a NextUI project. Instead of using traditional code block formatting, the installation commands and server start commands have been encapsulated within a new component called `<PackageManagers>`. This component takes a `commands` prop, which is an object mapping different package managers (npm, yarn, pnpm, bun) to their respective commands. 

The previous static code blocks for the commands have been replaced with this more dynamic and structured approach, allowing for better integration and potentially improved readability. The new format enhances the documentation by standardizing how commands are presented and making it easier to extend or modify in the future. Overall, this change reflects a shift towards a more component-driven documentation style, improving the user experience for developers following the installation guide.

## Alterations to the declarations of exported or public entities

- `<PackageManagers commands={{ npm: "cd my-nextui-app && npm install", yarn: "cd my-nextui-app && yarn install", pnpm: "cd my-nextui-app && pnpm install", bun: "cd my-nextui-app && bun install", }} />` in `apps/docs/content/docs/guide/installation.mdx` 
- `<PackageManagers commands={{ npm: "npm run dev", yarn: "yarn run dev", pnpm: "pnpm run dev", bun: "bun run dev", }} />` in `apps/docs/content/docs/guide/installation.mdx`
```

## PR Summary

The pull request titled "fix(docs): added missing package manager tabs in cli docs" was submitted by the user awesome-pro to address issue #3605. The main goal of this PR is to improve the CLI documentation by adding tabs for various package managers that were previously missing. Specifically, the update introduces tabs for `yarn`, `pnpm`, and `bun`, enabling users to view the appropriate commands for installing packages without global installation using these package managers. The PR includes before-and-after screenshots to demonstrate the changes made to the documentation. It is confirmed that this update does not introduce any breaking changes for existing NextUI users.

## Objectives from Linked Issues

The linked issue #3605 requests enhancements to the CLI documentation by incorporating support for additional package managers. It points out that the current documentation primarily focuses on using `npx` for package installation without global installation, which may not accommodate users who utilize other package managers such as `yarn`, `pnpm`, or `bun`. The proposed solution is to add separate tabs for each of these package runners, similar to the existing setup for global installation commands. Specifically, the issue suggests using `yarn dlx` for Yarn, `pnpm dlx` for pnpm, and `bun x` for Bun. The objective is to provide users with clear and accessible instructions for using their preferred package manager in the CLI documentation.

### Chat

There are 3 ways to chat with [CodeRabbit](https://coderabbit.ai):

- Review comments: Directly reply to a review comment made by CodeRabbit. Example:
	- `I pushed a fix in commit <commit_id>.`
	- `Generate unit testing code for this file.`
	- `Open a follow-up GitHub issue for this discussion.`
- Files and specific lines of code (under the "Files changed" tab): Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new review comment at the desired location with your query. Examples:
	- `@coderabbitai generate unit testing code for this file.`
	-	`@coderabbitai modularize this function.`
- PR comments: Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new PR comment to ask questions about the PR branch. For the best results, please provide a very specific query, as very limited context is provided in this mode. Examples:
	- `@coderabbitai generate interesting stats about this repository and render them as a table.`
	- `@coderabbitai show all the console.log statements in this repository.`
	- `@coderabbitai read src/utils.ts and generate unit testing code.`
	- `@coderabbitai read the files in the src/scheduler package and generate a class diagram using mermaid and a README in the markdown format.`
	- `@coderabbitai help me debug CodeRabbit configuration file.`

Note: Be mindful of the bot's finite context window. It's strongly recommended to break down tasks such as reading entire modules into smaller chunks. For a focused discussion, use review comments to chat about specific files and their changes, instead of using the PR comments.

### CodeRabbit Commands (invoked as PR comments)

- `@coderabbitai pause` to pause the reviews on a PR.
- `@coderabbitai resume` to resume the paused reviews.
- `@coderabbitai review` to trigger an incremental review. This is useful when automatic reviews are disabled for the repository.
- `@coderabbitai full review` to do a full review from scratch and review all the files again.
- `@coderabbitai summary` to regenerate the summary of the PR.
- `@coderabbitai resolve` resolve all the CodeRabbit review comments.
- `@coderabbitai configuration` to show the current CodeRabbit configuration for the repository.
- `@coderabbitai help` to get help.


Additionally, you can add `@coderabbitai ignore` anywhere in the PR description to prevent this PR from being reviewed.

### CodeRabbit Configuration File (`.coderabbit.yaml`)

- You can programmatically configure CodeRabbit by adding a `.coderabbit.yaml` file to the root of your repository.
- Please see the [configuration documentation](https://docs.coderabbit.ai/guides/configure-coderabbit) for more information.
- If your editor has YAML language server enabled, you can add the path at the top of this file to enable auto-completion and validation: `# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://coderabbit.ai/integrations/schema.v2.json`
