## Walkthrough

The recent changes improve the clarity and maintainability of the `App` component in the `async-pagination.ts` file. By using `React.useMemo` instead of `useMemo`, the code becomes more readable. Additionally, removing the spread operator from JSX alters how props are passed, which may impact component behavior. Overall, these adjustments refine the implementation while preserving the core functionality.

apps/docs/content/components/table/async-pagination.ts: ## AI-generated summary of changes

The diff introduces a modification to the `App` component in the `async-pagination.ts` file. The primary change involves the use of `React.useMemo` instead of just `useMemo`. This adjustment enhances clarity by explicitly referencing the `React` namespace, which can improve code readability and maintainability, especially in larger files where multiple libraries may be in use. Additionally, the removal of the spread operator `{...args}` from the JSX element indicates a change in how props are passed to the component, which may affect the component's behavior if `args` were previously utilized. Overall, these changes refine the component's implementation without altering its core functionality.



## Alterations to the declarations of exported or public entities

- No changes to the declarations of exported or public entities were made in `async-pagination.ts`.

## PR Summary

The pull request titled "fix(docs): add missing React and remove unexpected args" was created by user wingkwong and is identified as PR number 3652. It addresses an issue documented in #3625, where the sample code in the NextUI documentation was not runnable due to missing references. Specifically, the errors encountered were "ReferenceError: Can't find variable: useMemo" and "ReferenceError: Can't find variable: args." The PR aims to resolve these issues by adding the missing React import and removing any unexpected arguments from the sample code. The author has indicated that this change is necessary for the documentation to function correctly, allowing users to run the provided examples without encountering errors. The pull request does not specify whether it introduces any breaking changes, and additional information has not been provided.

## Objectives from Linked Issues

The linked issue #3625 describes a bug related to the NextUI Table component, specifically version 2.4.6. The primary objective is to resolve the "ReferenceError: Can't find variable: useMemo" and "ReferenceError: Can't find variable: args" errors that users encounter when attempting to run the sample code for the Table component. The issue report indicates that these errors prevent the proper functionality of the table, leading to a poor user experience. Users expect the documentation to provide runnable examples that accurately demonstrate the component's usage. The issue highlights the need for clear and functional documentation to ensure that users can implement the Table component effectively in their applications. The overall goal is to enhance the usability of the NextUI documentation by fixing the identified errors.

### Chat

There are 3 ways to chat with [CodeRabbit](https://coderabbit.ai):

- Review comments: Directly reply to a review comment made by CodeRabbit. Example:
	- `I pushed a fix in commit <commit_id>.`
	- `Generate unit testing code for this file.`
	- `Open a follow-up GitHub issue for this discussion.`
- Files and specific lines of code (under the "Files changed" tab): Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new review comment at the desired location with your query. Examples:
	- `@coderabbitai generate unit testing code for this file.`
	-	`@coderabbitai modularize this function.`
- PR comments: Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new PR comment to ask questions about the PR branch. For the best results, please provide a very specific query, as very limited context is provided in this mode. Examples:
	- `@coderabbitai generate interesting stats about this repository and render them as a table.`
	- `@coderabbitai show all the console.log statements in this repository.`
	- `@coderabbitai read src/utils.ts and generate unit testing code.`
	- `@coderabbitai read the files in the src/scheduler package and generate a class diagram using mermaid and a README in the markdown format.`
	- `@coderabbitai help me debug CodeRabbit configuration file.`

Note: Be mindful of the bot's finite context window. It's strongly recommended to break down tasks such as reading entire modules into smaller chunks. For a focused discussion, use review comments to chat about specific files and their changes, instead of using the PR comments.

### CodeRabbit Commands (invoked as PR comments)

- `@coderabbitai pause` to pause the reviews on a PR.
- `@coderabbitai resume` to resume the paused reviews.

- `@coderabbitai full review` to do a full review from scratch and review all the files again.
- `@coderabbitai summary` to regenerate the summary of the PR.
- `@coderabbitai resolve` resolve all the CodeRabbit review comments.
- `@coderabbitai configuration` to show the current CodeRabbit configuration for the repository.
- `@coderabbitai help` to get help.


Additionally, you can add `@coderabbitai ignore` anywhere in the PR description to prevent this PR from being reviewed.

### CodeRabbit Configuration File (`.coderabbit.yaml`)

- You can programmatically configure CodeRabbit by adding a `.coderabbit.yaml` file to the root of your repository.
- Please see the [configuration documentation](https://docs.coderabbit.ai/guides/configure-coderabbit) for more information.
