            "summary": "The text discusses Pull Request (PR) number 3490, titled \"fix(button): rescaling in disable animation,\" which was submitted by the contributor \"awesome-pro\" for the NextUI project on July 17, 2024. This PR addresses an issue related to the button component's behavior when the `disableAnimation` feature is activated, specifically focusing on a bug where the button would incorrectly rescale upon being pressed even when animations were disabled.\n\n### Key Changes Implemented\n\nThe primary objective of this PR is to correct the button rescaling issue when the `disableAnimation` property is set to true. The previous implementation allowed the button to rescale when pressed, which conflicted with the intended functionality. The new implementation ensures that when `disableAnimation` is true, the button maintains a consistent appearance without any rescaling effect. This fix is associated with issue #3489, which the PR successfully closes. Importantly, the changes made are non-breaking, meaning they will not disrupt existing functionality for users of the library.\n\n### Additional Modifications\n\nIn addition to the main fix for the button component, the PR includes other related updates, such as addressing card shadow clipping in listbox items. The modification comprises various updates and deletions across certain files, with the button rescaling fix specifically highlighted in the commit log.\n\n### Versioning and Deployment\n\nThis PR introduces changesets for two packages: `@nextui-org/theme` and `@nextui-org/react`, both of which will receive a patch update due to the changes made in this PR. The updates are slated for inclusion in the next version bump of the affected packages. The PR is currently labeled \"Status: Changes Requested,\" indicating that further modifications may be necessary before it can be merged. The latest commit in this PR is identified by the hash `450c58c14674c5bf91cc7a21481473548e3b60c8`.\n\nAn automated comment from a bot indicates that a deployment attempt to the Vercel platform is underway, which is associated with the NextUI organization. However, team member authorization is required for the deployment to proceed.\n\n### Detailed Code Changes\n\nThe changes made in the PR are documented as follows:\n\n1. **File Changes**:\n   - **File:** `packages/core/theme/src/components/button.ts`\n     - **Modification:** The `disableAnimation` property was adjusted to include additional styling for scale transformation when the button is not pressed. Now, when `disableAnimation` is set to false, the button will appropriately handle scaling effects without rescaling when it should not.\n   \n   - **File:** `.changeset/mean-goats-own.md`\n     - **Documentation:** A patch fix for the `disableAnimation` functionality in the button component is documented, clarifying the changes and outlining the resolution of issue #3489.\n\n### Resolution of the Issue\n\nThe original problem stemmed from the fact that the button component still underwent a rescaling transformation on press, even when `disableAnimation` was set to true. Users needed to add a specific class override (`data-[pressed=true]:scale-100`) to achieve the desired behavior. The source of this behavior was traced back to a line in the component's code that executed the rescaling irrespective of the intended effect of the `disableAnimation` prop.\n\n### Summary of Key Takeaways\n\n- The button component's functionality was enhanced to ensure that no unintended rescaling occurs when `disableAnimation` is set to true.\n- Additional styling for the button's scale transformation was introduced when it is not pressed, improving the overall user experience.\n- The detailed commit history and documentation within the pull request provide clarity on the changes made, ensuring developers are informed of the fixes.\n\n### Community Engagement and Tools\n\nThe text also references CodeRabbit, a tool for code reviews, and provides a series of commands that can be used within pull requests to streamline the review process. These commands include options to pause, resume, initiate, or conduct reviews, as well as to summarize changes and resolve comments. Developers can configure CodeRabbit using a `.coderabbit.yaml` file in the root of their repository for customized settings.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nOverall, this PR significantly enhances the user experience for the button component in the NextUI framework by resolving a specific bug related to button animations. The structured approach to managing updates, including documentation and automated systems for deployment, reflects an organized development process. The text highlights the importance of maintaining consistent UI behavior and provides actionable insights for developers facing similar issues, as well as encouraging community interaction through tools like CodeRabbit.",
