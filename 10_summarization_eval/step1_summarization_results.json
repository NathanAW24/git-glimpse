            "summary": "The provided information details a closed pull request (PR) numbered 3490, titled \"fix(button): rescaling in disable animation,\" which was created by the author awesome-pro on July 17, 2024. The PR aimed to address an issue with the `disableAnimation` property in the button component of the NextUI framework. The changes were made in the head branch named `fix/button-rescaling-in-disable-animation`, with the base branch being `canary`. \n\n### Summary of Changes:\n\n1. **Issue Addressed**: The primary goal of this PR was to resolve an issue referenced as #3489, which involved the button rescaling even when the `disableAnimation` property was set to true. Previously, users had to add a class override (`data-[pressed=true]:scale-100`) to prevent the rescaling, which was not the expected behavior.\n\n2. **New Behavior**: After the changes were implemented, the button no longer rescaled when `disableAnimation` was enabled, ensuring a consistent appearance for the button regardless of its state.\n\n3. **Nature of Changes**: The modifications made in this PR do not introduce any breaking changes, which means that existing functionality will not be adversely affected.\n\n4. **Files Modified**: The changes predominantly affected the following files:\n   - `packages/core/theme/src/components/button.ts`: The logic related to the `disableAnimation` property was updated to prevent scaling when the button is pressed. Specifically, it was modified to include additional styling for the `false` case to handle scale transformations properly.\n   - `.changeset/mean-goats-own.md`: This file was added to document the patch fix for the `disableAnimation` feature in the button component.\n\n5. **Specific Code Changes**:\n   ```typescript\n   const button = tv({\n       disableAnimation: {\n           true: \"!transition-none\",\n           false: \"data-[pressed=true]:scale-[0.97] transition-transform-colors-opacity motion-reduce:transition-none\",\n       },\n   });\n   ```\n   This code snippet showcases the modification where the `false` case was altered to include a scale transformation for the button when pressed, ensuring that it behaves correctly as per the expectations set by the `disableAnimation` property.\n\n### Additional Context:\n\n- **Participants**: The PR involved discussions between two participants, awesome-pro and wingkwong, regarding the effectiveness of the changes made. There were comments about the visibility of the effects of the `disableAnimation` property, indicating a potential misunderstanding of the issue being addressed.\n\n- **Commit History**: The commit history shows various minor fixes and updates related to the listbox component, in addition to the primary focus on the button component. Notably, there were two commits specifically related to the button's rescaling issue.\n\n- **Impact on Packages**: The changes will be included in the next version bump of the following packages:\n  - `@nextui-org/theme`: A patch was made to this package.\n  - `@nextui-org/react`: A patch was also noted for this package, indicating that the changes could affect the React components that depend on the theme package.\n\n- **Future Deployment**: There was an indication that a member of the NextUI team would need to authorize the deployment of the changes to Vercel, suggesting that the changes were intended for production deployment after successful merging.\n\nIn conclusion, this pull request effectively addressed a key issue regarding button animations in the NextUI framework, refining the user experience by ensuring that buttons remain consistent in appearance when the `disableAnimation` property is used. By resolving the issue without introducing breaking changes, this update enhances usability for developers utilizing the NextUI button component.",

            "summary": "The Pull Request (PR) number 4294 titled \"feat(docs): preserve scrolling position when navigating to new page\" was created by the author vinroger on December 9, 2024. This PR is currently open and targets the `canary` base branch, with the head branch being `eng-1643-preserve-scrolling-when-navigating-docs`. The primary goal of this PR is to improve user experience by ensuring that the scroll position of the documentation sidebar is preserved when users navigate between pages.\n\n### Key Features Introduced:\n1. **Scroll Position Preservation**:\n   - This functionality saves the current scroll position of the sidebar using session storage and restores it upon navigating to a new page.\n   - The scroll position is tracked through scroll events, storing the position whenever the user scrolls the sidebar.\n\n### Current vs. New Behavior:\n- **Current Behavior**:\n   - Users experience the sidebar resetting to the top every time they navigate to a new page, which can disrupt their exploration, especially in deeply nested documentation sections.\n  \n- **New Behavior**:\n   - The sidebar retains its scroll position, significantly enhancing the usability by removing the need to scroll back to previously viewed sections.\n\n### Implementation Details:\n- The implementation utilizes the `useLayoutEffect` hook to ensure the scroll position is restored after the sidebar is rendered.\n- Modifications were made to the `ScrollArea` and `Tree` components to support the new scroll preservation logic.\n- No additional dependencies were introduced, and the changes comply with the current architectural conventions of the project.\n\n### Files Affected:\n1. **`apps/docs/components/docs/sidebar.tsx`**:\n   - Introduced `scrollViewPortRef` to manage the scroll state.\n   - Updated the memoization dependencies for `treeContent`.\n   - Added `useLayoutEffect` for restoring scroll position from session storage.\n   - Implemented a `handleScroll` function to update the scroll position in session storage.\n\n2. **`apps/docs/components/scroll-area.tsx`**:\n   - Enhanced props to include `scrollViewPortRef`.\n   - Adjusted the destructuring of props to separate `onScroll` from `scrollViewPortRef`.\n   - Passed `scrollViewPortRef` and `onScroll` to the `ScrollAreaPrimitive.Viewport`.\n\n### Code Changes Summary:\nThe following key changes were made in the two primary files:\n\n- **In `sidebar.tsx`**:\n  - Added imports for additional hooks and utilities.\n  - Created a reference to track the scroll position.\n  - Implemented logic to save and restore the scroll position using session storage.\n\n- **In `scroll-area.tsx`**:\n  - Modified the component to accept a reference for the scroll viewport and the scroll event handler.\n  - Passed the reference and event handler to the `ScrollAreaPrimitive.Viewport`.\n\n### Additional Information:\n- The PR does not introduce any breaking changes.\n- Documentation was updated for clarity regarding the component props.\n- There are no new dependencies added to the project.\n  \n### Related PRs:\nThe PR mentions several possibly related PRs that deal with enhancing scrolling behavior and component interactions, which could provide additional context and functionality enhancements relevant to this scrolling feature.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThis PR significantly improves the user experience of the documentation sidebar by preserving the scroll position during navigation, which is particularly beneficial for users exploring extensive documentation. The changes made are well-structured and follow existing architectural guidelines, ensuring seamless integration with the current codebase. The implementation is detailed and straightforward, primarily focusing on managing scroll state through the use of React hooks and session storage, making it a valuable addition to the NextUI documentation. \n\n**Links**: For further details and to view the PR, visit the [Pull Request 4294](https://github.com/nextui-org/nextui/pull/4294).",
