+
+### Commit Convention
+
+Before you create a Pull Request, please check whether your commits comply with
+the commit conventions used in this repository.
+
+When you create a commit we kindly ask you to follow the convention
+`category(scope or module): message` in your commit message while using one of
+the following categories:
+
+- `feat / feature`: all changes that introduce completely new code or new
+  features
+- `fix`: changes that fix a bug (ideally you will additionally reference an
+  issue if present)
+- `refactor`: any code related change that is not a fix nor a feature
+- `docs`: changing existing or creating new documentation (i.e. README, docs for
+  usage of a lib or cli usage)
+- `build`: all changes regarding the build of the software, changes to
+  dependencies or the addition of new dependencies
+- `test`: all changes regarding tests (adding new tests or changing existing
+  ones)
+- `ci`: all changes regarding the configuration of continuous integration (i.e.
+  github actions, ci system)
+- `chore`: all changes to the repository that do not fit into any of the above
+  categories
+
+  e.g. `feat(components): add new prop to the avatar component`
+
+
+If you are interested in the detailed specification you can visit
+https://www.conventionalcommits.org/ or check out the
+[Angular Commit Message Guidelines](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/22b96b9/CONTRIBUTING.md#-commit-message-guidelines).

 ## Pull Request Guidelines
 
 - The `main` branch is basically a snapshot of the latest stable version. All development must be done in dedicated branches.
@@ -24,18 +68,48 @@ Hello!, I am very excited that you are interested in contributing with Next UI.
   - Provide a detailed description of the error in the PR. Favorite live demo.
   - Add the appropriate test coverage, if applicable.
 
+
+### Steps to PR
+
+1. Fork of the nextui repository and clone your fork
+
+2. Create a new branch out of the `main` branch. We follow the convention
+   `[type/scope]`. For example `fix/dropdown-hook` or `docs/menu-typo`. `type`
+   can be either `docs`, `fix`, `feat`, `build`, or any other conventional
+   commit type. `scope` is just a short id that describes the scope of work.
+
+3. Make and commit your changes following the
+   [commit convention](https://github.com/nextui-org/nextui/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit-convention).
+   As you develop, you can run `pnpm build --filter=<module>` and
+   `pnpm test packages/<module>/<pkg>` e.g. `pnpm build --filter=avatar & pnpm test packages/components/avatar` to make sure everything works as expected.
+
+   > To know more about the `--filter` option, please check the turborepo [docs](https://turborepo.org/docs/core-concepts/filtering).
+
+4. Run `pnpm changeset` to create a detailed description of your changes. This
+   will be used to generate a changelog when we publish an update.
+   [Learn more about Changeset](https://github.com/atlassian/changesets/tree/master/packages/cli).
+   Please note that you might have to run `git fetch origin main:master` (where
+   origin will be your fork on GitHub) before `pnpm changeset` works.
+5. Also, if you provide `jsx` snippets to the changeset, please turn off the
+   live preview by doing the following at the beginning of the snippet:
+   ` ```jsx live=false`
+
+> If you made minor changes like CI config, prettier, etc, you can run
+> `pnpm changeset add --empty` to generate an empty changeset file to document
+> your changes.

+This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).
+
+## Getting Started
+
+First, run the development server:
+
+```bash
+npm run dev
+# or
+yarn dev
+# or
+pnpm dev
+```
+
+Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
+
+You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
+
+[http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello) is an endpoint that uses [Route Handlers](https://beta.nextjs.org/docs/routing/route-handlers). This endpoint can be edited in `app/api/hello/route.ts`.
+
+This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
+
+## Learn More
+
+To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:
+
+- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
+- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.
+
+You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!
+
+## Deploy on Vercel
+
+The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
+
