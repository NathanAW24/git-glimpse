## Walkthrough

This update introduces a new function import, `parseAbsoluteToLocal`, from the `@internationalized/date` package to enhance timezone handling. Additionally, it modifies the file extension of the `/App` component from `.tsx` to `.jsx`, reflecting a shift in the JavaScript framework or library usage.

### PR Objectives

The pull request (PR) number 2801 titled "fix(docs): Date input - Time zone example code is not showing js (code mode)" addresses an issue in the documentation related to the Date input component, specifically in the Time zones example section. The main concern highlighted is the unnecessary separation of TypeScript (ts) and JavaScript (js) code examples for this component, as the existing JavaScript code example is missing.

The PR aims to unify the TypeScript and JavaScript code examples, making them identical, as there is no need for separate examples in this context. This change is intended to simplify the documentation and ensure that both TypeScript and JavaScript users have access to the same example code.

The description indicates that the current behavior in the documentation shows a gap where the JavaScript code should be, described as "nothing (Sample app code)." The proposed change will correct this by ensuring that the TypeScript and JavaScript code examples are the same, thereby filling in the missing JavaScript code example.

This change is not a breaking change, meaning it does not alter the functionality in a way that would require users to modify their existing code or usage of the component.

### AI-Generated Summary of Generated Summaries

The code changes involve updating the documentation for the Date input component's Time zones example. Specifically, the `parseAbsoluteToLocal` function is now imported from `@internationalized/date`, and the file extension for the `/App` component has been changed from `.tsx` to `.jsx`. This aligns with the PR's objective to standardize the code examples for both TypeScript and JavaScript, ensuring consistency across the documentation.

`2-2`: The addition of `parseAbsoluteToLocal` from `@internationalized/date` is appropriate for the functionality of the component.

`1-5`: > :memo: **NOTE**
> This review was outside the diff hunks and was mapped to the diff hunk with the greatest overlap. Original lines [1-20]

The usage of `parseZonedDateTime` and `parseAbsoluteToLocal` in the `defaultValue` properties of `DateInput` components is correctly implemented.

---

`22-22`: Please confirm that the file extension for the `/App` component has been correctly changed from `.tsx` to `.jsx` as intended.

### Chat

There are 3 ways to chat with [CodeRabbit](https://coderabbit.ai):

- Review comments: Directly reply to a review comment made by CodeRabbit. Example:
	- `I pushed a fix in commit <commit_id>.`
	- `Generate unit testing code for this file.`
	- `Open a follow-up GitHub issue for this discussion.`
- Files and specific lines of code (under the "Files changed" tab): Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new review comment at the desired location with your query. Examples:
	- `@coderabbitai generate unit testing code for this file.`
	-	`@coderabbitai modularize this function.`
- PR comments: Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new PR comment to ask questions about the PR branch. For the best results, please provide a very specific query, as very limited context is provided in this mode. Examples:
	- `@coderabbitai generate interesting stats about this repository and render them as a table.`
	- `@coderabbitai show all the console.log statements in this repository.`
	- `@coderabbitai read src/utils.ts and generate unit testing code.`
	- `@coderabbitai read the files in the src/scheduler package and generate a class diagram using mermaid and a README in the markdown format.`

Note: Be mindful of the bot's finite context window. It's strongly recommended to break down tasks such as reading entire modules into smaller chunks. For a focused discussion, use review comments to chat about specific files and their changes, instead of using the PR comments.

### CodeRabbit Commands (invoked as PR comments)

- `@coderabbitai pause` to pause the reviews on a PR.
- `@coderabbitai resume` to resume the paused reviews.
- `@coderabbitai review` to trigger a review. This is useful when automatic reviews are disabled for the repository.
- `@coderabbitai resolve` resolve all the CodeRabbit review comments.
- `@coderabbitai help` to get help.


Additionally, you can add `@coderabbitai ignore` anywhere in the PR description to prevent this PR from being reviewed.

### CodeRabbit Configration File (`.coderabbit.yaml`)
