## Walkthrough

This update introduces a patch for the `@nextui-org/theme` package, fixing an issue where the `disableAnimation` property did not fully disable button scaling on press. The fix ensures that when `disableAnimation` is set to `true`, an additional class `data-[pressed=true]:scale-100` is applied, thereby preventing the unintended scaling effect.

## PR Summary

**Title:** fix(theme): button scaling when disableAnimation is true  
**User:** wingkwong  
**Number:** 3499  
**URL:** [https://github.com/nextui-org/nextui/pull/3499](https://github.com/nextui-org/nextui/pull/3499)  

**Description:**  
This pull request addresses a bug related to the `disableAnimation` prop in the Button component of the NextUI library. The issue is that the button's `disableAnimation` prop should prevent the rescaling animation on press, but it currently requires an additional `data-[pressed=true]:scale-100` class override to function correctly. The root cause is identified as a change in the button component's source code, which inadvertently broke the expected behavior of the `disableAnimation` prop. This PR aims to fix this issue by ensuring that the button does not resize on press when `disableAnimation` is true.

## Objectives from Linked Issues

**Linked Issue:** #3489: [BUG] - `disableAnimation` prop not working in Button component  

**Objectives:**
- **NextUI Version:** @nextui-org/button@2.0.31
- **Bug Description:** The `disableAnimation` prop should disable the rescaling animation on press, but currently, it requires an additional class override to achieve this.
- **Root Cause:** The issue is traced to a specific line in the button component's source code, which is applied even when `disableAnimation` is passed, due to a previous change.
- **Expected Behavior:** When `disableAnimation` is passed, the button should not resize on press.
- **Steps to Reproduce:** The issue can be observed in Storybook where the button resizing on press effect remains even when `disableAnimation` is true.
- **Browser and OS:** The issue is noted on Chrome and MacOS.

This PR aims to resolve the issue by ensuring that the `disableAnimation` prop functions as expected, preventing the button from resizing on press.

### Chat

There are 3 ways to chat with [CodeRabbit](https://coderabbit.ai):

- Review comments: Directly reply to a review comment made by CodeRabbit. Example:
	- `I pushed a fix in commit <commit_id>.`
	- `Generate unit testing code for this file.`
	- `Open a follow-up GitHub issue for this discussion.`
- Files and specific lines of code (under the "Files changed" tab): Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new review comment at the desired location with your query. Examples:
	- `@coderabbitai generate unit testing code for this file.`
	-	`@coderabbitai modularize this function.`
- PR comments: Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new PR comment to ask questions about the PR branch. For the best results, please provide a very specific query, as very limited context is provided in this mode. Examples:
	- `@coderabbitai generate interesting stats about this repository and render them as a table.`
	- `@coderabbitai show all the console.log statements in this repository.`
	- `@coderabbitai read src/utils.ts and generate unit testing code.`
	- `@coderabbitai read the files in the src/scheduler package and generate a class diagram using mermaid and a README in the markdown format.`
	- `@coderabbitai help me debug CodeRabbit configuration file.`

Note: Be mindful of the bot's finite context window. It's strongly recommended to break down tasks such as reading entire modules into smaller chunks. For a focused discussion, use review comments to chat about specific files and their changes, instead of using the PR comments.

### CodeRabbit Commands (invoked as PR comments)

- `@coderabbitai pause` to pause the reviews on a PR.
- `@coderabbitai resume` to resume the paused reviews.

- `@coderabbitai full review` to do a full review from scratch and review all the files again.
- `@coderabbitai summary` to regenerate the summary of the PR.
- `@coderabbitai resolve` resolve all the CodeRabbit review comments.
- `@coderabbitai configuration` to show the current CodeRabbit configuration for the repository.
- `@coderabbitai help` to get help.


Additionally, you can add `@coderabbitai ignore` anywhere in the PR description to prevent this PR from being reviewed.

### CodeRabbit Configuration File (`.coderabbit.yaml`)

- You can programmatically configure CodeRabbit by adding a `.coderabbit.yaml` file to the root of your repository.
- Please see the [configuration documentation](https://docs.coderabbit.ai/guides/configure-coderabbit) for more information.
