üìù Description

revised shouldCloseOnInteractOutside in FreeSoloPopover
some people suggested to set allowsCustomValue to true. This could temporarily make the popover close because it makes the inputRef.current not to blur so that Autocomplete won't be re-rendered with isOpen = true. However, this won't blur the input if the selection is empty (i.e. it'll stay focused).

## Walkthrough

This update addresses a persistent issue found in the "@nextui-org/popover" package, specifically affecting the behavior of the `FreeSoloPopover` component within modals. The patch ensures the popover now properly closes when a user interacts outside of it, even when no item has been selected in the autocomplete component. This change directly targets and resolves issues reported by users experiencing difficulties with popover functionality in modal contexts.

### PR Objectives

This Pull Request (PR) addresses a specific issue with the NextUI library, particularly focusing on a bug related to the `Autocomplete` component when used within a modal. The primary objective is to fix the problem where the popover of the `Autocomplete` component fails to close upon clicking outside of it when the component is placed inside an open modal. This issue has been a recurring problem, as evidenced by the linked issues (#2475, #2082, and #1987), indicating a significant impact on user experience across different versions of NextUI.

The PR introduces a fix by revising the `shouldCloseOnInteractOutside` function within the `FreeSoloPopover` component. The proposed solution ensures that the popover can now be closed as expected when interacting outside of it, even when the `Autocomplete` component is used within a modal. This change addresses the core of the problem, which was previously attempted to be circumvented by setting `allowsCustomValue` to `true`. While this workaround prevented the `inputRef.current` from blurring and inadvertently kept the popover open, it introduced another issue where the input would remain focused even when the selection was empty.

The PR includes a demonstration video hosted on the NextUI GitHub repository, showcasing the corrected behavior of the `Autocomplete` component within a modal, thus providing a visual confirmation of the fix.

The linked issues provide additional context, describing the bug's manifestation across different operating systems and browsers, and highlighting the user's inability to close the `Autocomplete` popover by clicking outside or using the chevron icon. These issues have been persistent since at least version 2.2.9 of NextUI, affecting users on both Windows and macOS platforms.

In summary, this PR aims to enhance the usability of the NextUI library by ensuring that the `Autocomplete` component functions correctly within modals, addressing a long-standing issue that has affected multiple users across various environments.

### AI-generated Summary of Generated Summaries

The Pull Request introduces a patch for the NextUI library, specifically targeting the `Autocomplete` component's popover functionality within modals. The core of the fix lies in the adjustment of the `shouldCloseOnInteractOutside` function within the `FreeSoloPopover` component. Previously, the inability to close the popover by interacting outside of it posed a significant usability issue when the `Autocomplete` component was used in a modal context. This problem was documented across multiple issues, indicating a recurring challenge for users.

The solution implemented in this PR directly addresses the root cause by ensuring the `shouldCloseOnInteractOutside` function consistently returns `false`, thereby allowing the popover to close as expected upon external interactions. This change rectifies the previously suggested workaround, which involved setting `allowsCustomValue` to `true` but led to unintended focus behavior on the input element.

By resolving this issue, the PR significantly improves the user experience for those utilizing the `Autocomplete` component within modals, ensuring consistent and expected behavior across various platforms and browsers. This enhancement is demonstrated through a video linked in the PR, visually confirming the effectiveness of the fix.

### Chat

There are 3 ways to chat with CodeRabbit:

- Review comments: Directly reply to a review comment made by CodeRabbit. Example:
	- `I pushed a fix in commit <commit_id>.`
	- `Generate unit-tests for this file.`
	- `Open a follow-up GitHub issue for this discussion.`
- Files and specific lines of code (under the "Files changed" tab): Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new review comment at the desired location with your query. Examples:
	- `@coderabbitai generate unit tests for this file.`
	-	`@coderabbitai modularize this function.`
- PR comments: Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new PR comment to ask questions about the PR branch. For the best results, please provide a very specific query, as very limited context is provided in this mode. Examples:
	- `@coderabbitai generate interesting stats about this repository and render them as a table.`
	- `@coderabbitai show all the console.log statements in this repository.`
	- `@coderabbitai read src/utils.ts and generate unit tests.`
	- `@coderabbitai read the files in the src/scheduler package and generate a class diagram using mermaid and a README in the markdown format.`

Note: Be mindful of the bot's finite context window. It's strongly recommended to break down tasks such as reading entire modules into smaller chunks. For a focused discussion, use review comments to chat about specific files and their changes, instead of using the PR comments.
