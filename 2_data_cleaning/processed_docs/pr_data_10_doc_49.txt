### PR Summary

User `wingkwong` has submitted a pull request (PR) numbered 2990 with the title "fix(theme): remove origin-bottom from button" to the NextUI repository. The PR aims to address an issue with the current styling of a button by removing the `origin-bottom` property.

The description of the PR indicates that it is intended to fix a specific issue, though the exact issue number on GitHub is not mentioned as the placeholder `<!-- Github issue # here -->` remains unfilled. The PR adheres to the repository's guidelines by focusing on a single type of change, which in this case is a bugfix.

The PR includes before and after screenshots to visually demonstrate the changes. The "Current behavior" section shows the button with the `origin-bottom` property applied, and the "New behavior" section shows the button after the property has been removed. However, the images are referenced by URLs and are not directly viewable in the text.

The PR does not add any new external dependencies and is kept concise to facilitate a quicker review process. There is no indication that this change is a breaking one, as the section asking whether it is a breaking change is left unanswered, and no additional information on the impact or migration path for existing users is provided.

Overall, this PR focuses on a specific styling fix within the NextUI framework by removing an undesired CSS property from a button component to presumably improve its visual presentation or functionality.

### Chat

There are 3 ways to chat with [CodeRabbit](https://coderabbit.ai):

- Review comments: Directly reply to a review comment made by CodeRabbit. Example:
	- `I pushed a fix in commit <commit_id>.`
	- `Generate unit testing code for this file.`
	- `Open a follow-up GitHub issue for this discussion.`
- Files and specific lines of code (under the "Files changed" tab): Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new review comment at the desired location with your query. Examples:
	- `@coderabbitai generate unit testing code for this file.`
	-	`@coderabbitai modularize this function.`
- PR comments: Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new PR comment to ask questions about the PR branch. For the best results, please provide a very specific query, as very limited context is provided in this mode. Examples:
	- `@coderabbitai generate interesting stats about this repository and render them as a table.`
	- `@coderabbitai show all the console.log statements in this repository.`
	- `@coderabbitai read src/utils.ts and generate unit testing code.`
	- `@coderabbitai read the files in the src/scheduler package and generate a class diagram using mermaid and a README in the markdown format.`

Note: Be mindful of the bot's finite context window. It's strongly recommended to break down tasks such as reading entire modules into smaller chunks. For a focused discussion, use review comments to chat about specific files and their changes, instead of using the PR comments.

### CodeRabbit Commands (invoked as PR comments)

- `@coderabbitai pause` to pause the reviews on a PR.
- `@coderabbitai resume` to resume the paused reviews.
- `@coderabbitai review` to trigger a review. This is useful when automatic reviews are disabled for the repository.
- `@coderabbitai resolve` resolve all the CodeRabbit review comments.
- `@coderabbitai help` to get help.


Additionally, you can add `@coderabbitai ignore` anywhere in the PR description to prevent this PR from being reviewed.

### CodeRabbit Configration File (`.coderabbit.yaml`)

- You can programmatically configure CodeRabbit by adding a `.coderabbit.yaml` file to the root of your repository.
- Please see the [configuration documentation](https://docs.coderabbit.ai/guides/configure-coderabbit) for more information.
- If your editor has YAML language server enabled, you can add the path at the top of this file to enable auto-completion and validation: `# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://coderabbit.ai/integrations/schema.v2.json`
