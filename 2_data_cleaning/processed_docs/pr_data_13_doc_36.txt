### PR Objectives

This pull request, numbered 2668, aims to address a customization issue with the Progress component within the NextUI library. The core problem, detailed in linked issue #2153, is the inability to customize the Progress component's slots due to the `twMerge` parameter being set to false in the component's theme configuration. This limitation prevented the application of custom class names, as the default class name would override any user customizations.

The proposed fix involves changing the `twMerge` parameter from false to true within the `progress` theme configuration to enable slot customization by merging Tailwind CSS classes. The pull request includes visual evidence demonstrating the current behavior where customization is not possible and the new behavior post-fix, where customization is achievable through `twMerge`.

Additionally, a new story is introduced in the progress component stories file, showcasing customization capabilities with `twMerge` set to true. This story provides a practical example of applying custom class names to the Progress component.

The issue described a scenario where a user tried to customize the `Progress` component's base class to `flex-row-reverse` instead of the default `flex-col`. However, due to `twMerge` being false, the expected behavior of replacing `flex-col` with `flex-row-reverse` did not occur, resulting in both classes being applied simultaneously. This anomaly was isolated to `progress.ts`, where `twMerge` was set to false, unlike other components in the source code.

The pull request confirms this change is non-breaking, indicating existing Progress component implementations should not be adversely affected. Additional information is provided to aid in understanding the context and rationale behind the proposed changes.

### AI-generated Summary of Generated Summaries

The pull request introduces a significant update to the NextUI library, focusing on enhancing the customization capabilities of the Progress component. The key change involves switching the `twMerge` parameter in the `progress` theme configuration from false to true, enabling the merging of Tailwind CSS classes for more flexible slot customization. A new story in the progress component stories demonstrates successful application of custom class names.

Addressing issue #2153, where `twMerge` set to false hindered Progress component customization, the PR resolves this by allowing users to apply custom class names without interference from default settings. This non-breaking change enhances customization without disrupting existing implementations of the Progress component.

### Chat

There are 3 ways to chat with [CodeRabbit](https://coderabbit.ai):

- Review comments: Directly reply to a review comment made by CodeRabbit. Example:
	- `I pushed a fix in commit <commit_id>.`
	- `Generate unit testing code for this file.`
	- `Open a follow-up GitHub issue for this discussion.`
- Files and specific lines of code (under the "Files changed" tab): Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new review comment at the desired location with your query. Examples:
	- `@coderabbitai generate unit testing code for this file.`
	-	`@coderabbitai modularize this function.`
- PR comments: Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new PR comment to ask questions about the PR branch. For the best results, please provide a very specific query, as very limited context is provided in this mode. Examples:
	- `@coderabbitai generate interesting stats about this repository and render them as a table.`
	- `@coderabbitai show all the console.log statements in this repository.`
	- `@coderabbitai read src/utils.ts and generate unit testing code.`
	- `@coderabbitai read the files in the src/scheduler package and generate a class diagram using mermaid and a README in the markdown format.`

Note: Be mindful of the bot's finite context window. It's strongly recommended to break down tasks such as reading entire modules into smaller chunks. For a focused discussion, use review comments to chat about specific files and their changes, instead of using the PR comments.

### CodeRabbit Commands (invoked as PR comments)

- `@coderabbitai pause` to pause the reviews on a PR.
- `@coderabbitai resume` to resume the paused reviews.
- `@coderabbitai review` to trigger a review. This is useful when automatic reviews are disabled for the repository.
- `@coderabbitai resolve` resolve all the CodeRabbit review comments.
- `@coderabbitai help` to get help.


Additionally, you can add `@coderabbitai ignore` anywhere in the PR description to prevent this PR from being reviewed.

### CodeRabbit Configration File (`.coderabbit.yaml`)
