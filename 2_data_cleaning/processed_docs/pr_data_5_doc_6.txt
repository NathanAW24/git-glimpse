## Walkthrough
A patch has been introduced for the `@nextui-org/image` package, specifically updating the `getWrapperProps` function to include a missing dependency `w`. This change ensures that the function references all necessary dependencies, enhancing its reliability. Additionally, the `useEffect` hook in the `useImage` function has been modified to include `w` in its dependency array, allowing the effect to re-run when `w` changes, which may influence image rendering and layout.

## AI-generated summary of changes

A new patch has been introduced for the package `@nextui-org/image`, which includes an update to the `getWrapperProps` function. Specifically, the change adds a missing `w` to the dependencies of this function. This adjustment ensures that the function correctly references all necessary dependencies, potentially improving its functionality and reliability. Additionally, the dependency array of a `useEffect` hook within the `useImage` function in the `packages/components/image/src/use-image.ts` file has been modified. The updated version adds `w` to the dependency array, indicating that the effect will now also re-run when the value of `w` changes, which may affect how the component behaves in relation to image rendering or layout adjustments.



## Alterations to the declarations of exported or public entities

- Dependency updated: `getWrapperProps` in `@nextui-org/image` to include the missing `w`.
- No alterations to the declarations of exported or public entities were made in the `use-image.ts` file.

## PR Summary

The pull request titled "fix(image): add missing `w` to `getWrapperProps` dependency" was created by the user wingkwong and is identified as PR number 3802. This PR addresses an issue related to the image component in the NextUI library. It specifically aims to resolve a bug where the image's maximum width is not updated due to the absence of the `w` property in the dependencies of the `getWrapperProps` function. The PR is linked to issue #3801, which details the bug and its impact on the image component's behavior. The description section of the PR template is largely unfilled, indicating that the user may have intended to provide additional context but did not do so. The PR does not indicate whether it introduces any breaking changes.

## Objectives from Linked Issues

The linked issue #3801 titled "[BUG] - Image width not updating max-width" outlines a specific bug in the NextUI library version 2.4.8. The issue describes that the maximum width of an image is not being updated correctly because the relevant property is not included in the dependencies of the `getWrapperProps` function. The user provides a reproduction scenario, which involves clicking a button to change the image, and notes that the expected behavior is for the wrapper's maximum width to update accordingly. The issue includes a link to a StackBlitz example that demonstrates the problem, allowing for easier reproduction and understanding of the bug. The user reports that this issue occurs on macOS using the Chrome browser.

### Chat

There are 3 ways to chat with [CodeRabbit](https://coderabbit.ai):

- Review comments: Directly reply to a review comment made by CodeRabbit. Example:
-- `I pushed a fix in commit <commit_id>, please review it.`
-- `Generate unit testing code for this file.`
	- `Open a follow-up GitHub issue for this discussion.`
- Files and specific lines of code (under the "Files changed" tab): Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new review comment at the desired location with your query. Examples:
-- `@coderabbitai generate unit testing code for this file.`
--	`@coderabbitai modularize this function.`
- PR comments: Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new PR comment to ask questions about the PR branch. For the best results, please provide a very specific query, as very limited context is provided in this mode. Examples:
-- `@coderabbitai gather interesting stats about this repository and render them as a table. Additionally, render a pie chart showing the language distribution in the codebase.`
-- `@coderabbitai read src/utils.ts and generate unit testing code.`
-- `@coderabbitai read the files in the src/scheduler package and generate a class diagram using mermaid and a README in the markdown format.`
-- `@coderabbitai help me debug CodeRabbit configuration file.`

Note: Be mindful of the bot's finite context window. It's strongly recommended to break down tasks such as reading entire modules into smaller chunks. For a focused discussion, use review comments to chat about specific files and their changes, instead of using the PR comments.
