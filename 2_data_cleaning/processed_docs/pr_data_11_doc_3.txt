## Walkthrough

The modifications involve updating CSS class selectors in a styling file for a documentation component. The primary change is the adjustment of the pseudo-class from `focused` to `focus`, ensuring consistency and potentially correcting a mistake in the state handling of UI components. This affects both the default and dark mode specific styles.

### PR Summary

The pull request (PR) titled "Update custom-styles.ts" with the number 2982 addresses an issue in a code demonstration where the data attribute for an input element is incorrectly used as `data-focused` instead of `data-focus`, which is the correct attribute as per the documentation. The incorrect attribute does not function as intended, prompting this correction.

The PR does not specify the exact changes made in the description, but it implies a correction to the attribute usage in the demonstration code. There is a placeholder for adding a brief description under the "Description" section, and placeholders for describing the current and new behaviors under "Current behavior (updates)" and "New behavior" sections, respectively. These sections were not filled out by the author, leaving them incomplete.

Additionally, the PR includes a section to indicate whether the changes constitute a breaking change, but this is left unanswered with a placeholder for the user to specify the impact and any necessary migration path for existing users.

The PR also references a GitHub issue with the placeholder "Closes # <!-- Github issue # here -->", suggesting that it is intended to resolve a specific issue, but the exact issue number is not provided in the provided text.

Overall, the PR aims to correct a specific error in a code example related to data attributes on an input element, ensuring it aligns with the proper documentation standards. The incomplete sections suggest that further details were intended to be added but were not included at the time of this summary.

### Chat

There are 3 ways to chat with [CodeRabbit](https://coderabbit.ai):

- Review comments: Directly reply to a review comment made by CodeRabbit. Example:
	- `I pushed a fix in commit <commit_id>.`
	- `Generate unit testing code for this file.`
	- `Open a follow-up GitHub issue for this discussion.`
- Files and specific lines of code (under the "Files changed" tab): Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new review comment at the desired location with your query. Examples:
	- `@coderabbitai generate unit testing code for this file.`
	-	`@coderabbitai modularize this function.`
- PR comments: Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new PR comment to ask questions about the PR branch. For the best results, please provide a very specific query, as very limited context is provided in this mode. Examples:
	- `@coderabbitai generate interesting stats about this repository and render them as a table.`
	- `@coderabbitai show all the console.log statements in this repository.`
	- `@coderabbitai read src/utils.ts and generate unit testing code.`
	- `@coderabbitai read the files in the src/scheduler package and generate a class diagram using mermaid and a README in the markdown format.`

Note: Be mindful of the bot's finite context window. It's strongly recommended to break down tasks such as reading entire modules into smaller chunks. For a focused discussion, use review comments to chat about specific files and their changes, instead of using the PR comments.

### CodeRabbit Commands (invoked as PR comments)

- `@coderabbitai pause` to pause the reviews on a PR.
- `@coderabbitai resume` to resume the paused reviews.
- `@coderabbitai review` to trigger a review. This is useful when automatic reviews are disabled for the repository.
- `@coderabbitai resolve` resolve all the CodeRabbit review comments.
- `@coderabbitai help` to get help.


Additionally, you can add `@coderabbitai ignore` anywhere in the PR description to prevent this PR from being reviewed.

### CodeRabbit Configration File (`.coderabbit.yaml`)

- You can programmatically configure CodeRabbit by adding a `.coderabbit.yaml` file to the root of your repository.
- Please see the [configuration documentation](https://docs.coderabbit.ai/guides/configure-coderabbit) for more information.
- If your editor has YAML language server enabled, you can add the path at the top of this file to enable auto-completion and validation: `# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://coderabbit.ai/integrations/schema.v2.json`
