- **Title:** feat(docs): preserve scrolling position when navigating to new page
- **Author:** vinroger
- **State:** OPEN
- **Created At:** December 9, 2024
- **URL:** [GitHub Link](https://github.com/nextui-org/nextui/pull/4294)

**Overview:**
This pull request introduces a feature to maintain the scroll position of the documentation sidebar when users navigate between pages. This enhancement aims to improve user experience by eliminating the need for manual scrolling back to previous sections.

**Current vs. New Behavior:**

**Technical Details:**
- Implemented using the `useLayoutEffect` hook to restore scroll position after rendering.
- Modifications made to the `ScrollArea` and `Tree` components to enable scroll preservation.
- No new dependencies were added, and the changes align with existing project architecture.

**Benefits:**
- Enhances user navigation within deeply nested documentation sections.
- Improves overall usability by providing a smoother experience when returning to previous content.

**Additional Notes:**
- This enhancement does not introduce any breaking changes to the existing functionality.
- The implementation has been tested across multiple browsers including Safari, Chrome, and Firefox. 

**Files Changed:**
- `apps/docs/components/docs/sidebar.tsx`
- `apps/docs/components/scroll-area.tsx`

**Conclusion:**
This pull request aims to significantly enhance the user experience within the documentation by preserving the scroll position, thereby making navigation more intuitive.
