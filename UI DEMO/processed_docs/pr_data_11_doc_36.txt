## Walkthrough
This update modifies the type of the `selected` state variable in the `App` component from a combination of `string` or `number` to the more inclusive `React.Key` type. This change enhances type consistency and potentially broadens the usability of the `selected` state across different contexts within the application.

## Changes

| File | Change Summary |
|------|----------------|

The description indicates a shift from using a basic union type (`string | number`) to a more descriptive type alias (`React.Key`).

The PR is categorized under documentation updates, suggesting that the primary goal is to improve code readability and maintainability without altering the functionality. The description underscores that there are no new behaviors introduced and no breaking changes. The PR adheres to the guidelines of keeping changes minimal and focused, as it only involves a type refinement in a single component.

### AI-Generated Summary of Generated Summaries

The pull request makes a specific update in the `form.ts` file, which is part of the documentation for components. It modifies the type of the `selected` state variable in the `App` component. Originally, this variable was declared with the type `string | number`. The PR updates this to `React.Key`, which is a more expressive and appropriate type for representing keys in React components. This change is intended to enhance the clarity and correctness of the type usage without affecting the current behavior of the application.

### Chat

There are 3 ways to chat with [CodeRabbit](https://coderabbit.ai):

- Review comments: Directly reply to a review comment made by CodeRabbit. Example:
	- `I pushed a fix in commit <commit_id>.`
	- `Generate unit testing code for this file.`
	- `Open a follow-up GitHub issue for this discussion.`
- Files and specific lines of code (under the "Files changed" tab): Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new review comment at the desired location with your query. Examples:
	- `@coderabbitai generate unit testing code for this file.`
	-	`@coderabbitai modularize this function.`
- PR comments: Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new PR comment to ask questions about the PR branch. For the best results, please provide a very specific query, as very limited context is provided in this mode. Examples:
	- `@coderabbitai generate interesting stats about this repository and render them as a table.`
	- `@coderabbitai show all the console.log statements in this repository.`
	- `@coderabbitai read src/utils.ts and generate unit testing code.`
	- `@coderabbitai read the files in the src/scheduler package and generate a class diagram using mermaid and a README in the markdown format.`

Note: Be mindful of the bot's finite context window. It's strongly recommended to break down tasks such as reading entire modules into smaller chunks. For a focused discussion, use review comments to chat about specific files and their changes, instead of using the PR comments.

### CodeRabbit Commands (invoked as PR comments)

- `@coderabbitai pause` to pause the reviews on a PR.
- `@coderabbitai resume` to resume the paused reviews.
- `@coderabbitai review` to trigger a review. This is useful when automatic reviews are disabled for the repository.
- `@coderabbitai resolve` resolve all the CodeRabbit review comments.
- `@coderabbitai help` to get help.


Additionally, you can add `@coderabbitai ignore` anywhere in the PR description to prevent this PR from being reviewed.

### CodeRabbit Configration File (`.coderabbit.yaml`)
