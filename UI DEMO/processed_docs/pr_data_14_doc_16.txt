## Walkthrough

This update introduces enhancements and fixes to the `@nextui-org/radio` package, specifically addressing a bug related to form submission with the `RadioGroup` component. The changes include improvements in prop handling and ref merging within the `useRadio` function, aiming to ensure that the `isRequired` attribute on `RadioGroup` functions as expected, preventing form submission when no option is selected.

.changeset/thirty-islands-trade.md: The new file introduces a patch for "@nextui-org/radio" to fix missing required props and validationMessage.

---

packages/components/radio/src/use-radio.ts: In `use-radio.ts`, the `useRadio` function now utilizes `mergeRefs` from `@nextui-org/react-utils` to merge refs, and `mergeProps` is used to combine props more efficiently, affecting the control flow and logic of handling input properties.

### PR Objectives

This pull request, numbered 2597, aims to fix a bug in the NextUI library related to the `RadioGroup` component. The bug, documented in issue #2585, involves the incorrect behavior of the `isRequired` attribute within the `RadioGroup`. Despite setting `isRequired={true}`, the form submission proceeds even when no option is selected, contrary to the expected behavior of requiring at least one option to be chosen before submission.

The PR intends to resolve this issue by ensuring that the `isRequired` property functions correctly, preventing form submission when no option is selected and `isRequired` is true. Additionally, it merges the `validationMessage` with `domRef` to maintain the component's ability to display validation messages effectively.

Demonstrations of the bug and the proposed fix are provided through video links, showing the current behavior where form submission is not blocked without a selection and the expected behavior post-fix where submission is prevented until an option is chosen.

The PR confirms that this fix does not introduce any breaking changes, preserving backward compatibility and ensuring that existing implementations of the `RadioGroup` component remain unaffected beyond the addressed bug.

### AI-generated Summary of Generated Summaries

This PR targets the `@nextui-org/radio` package, specifically focusing on `use-radio.ts`. The key changes involve enhancing the handling of the `isRequired` attribute and `validationMessage` for the `RadioGroup` component. By utilizing `mergeRefs` from `@nextui-org/react-utils` to merge references efficiently and employing `mergeProps` to combine properties effectively, the fix ensures that the `isRequired` property enforces the selection requirement within the `RadioGroup` for form submission. The adjustments maintain the component's validation message display functionality while addressing the bug without causing any breaking changes. This approach enhances the library's functionality while upholding compatibility with existing implementations.

### Chat

There are 3 ways to chat with CodeRabbit:

- Review comments: Directly reply to a review comment made by CodeRabbit. Example:
	- `I pushed a fix in commit <commit_id>.`
	- `Generate unit testing code for this file.`
	- `Open a follow-up GitHub issue for this discussion.`
- Files and specific lines of code (under the "Files changed" tab): Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new review comment at the desired location with your query. Examples:
	- `@coderabbitai generate unit testing code for this file.`
	-	`@coderabbitai modularize this function.`
- PR comments: Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new PR comment to ask questions about the PR branch. For the best results, please provide a very specific query, as very limited context is provided in this mode. Examples:
	- `@coderabbitai generate interesting stats about this repository and render them as a table.`
	- `@coderabbitai show all the console.log statements in this repository.`
	- `@coderabbitai read src/utils.ts and generate unit testing code.`
	- `@coderabbitai read the files in the src/scheduler package and generate a class diagram using mermaid and a README in the markdown format.`

Note: Be mindful of the bot's finite context window. It's strongly recommended to break down tasks such as reading entire modules into smaller chunks. For a focused discussion, use review comments to chat about specific files and their changes, instead of using the PR comments.

### CodeRabbit Commands (invoked as PR comments)
