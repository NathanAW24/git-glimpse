### PR Objectives

This pull request, titled "fix: changed breakpoint to md #2629" and numbered 2630, addresses a specific issue with the NextUI library, particularly concerning the Navbar component's responsiveness and consistency across different types. The problem was initially reported in issue #2629, where it was noted that the signup button in the Navbar with a menu was getting clipped in certain storybook stories. This clipping occurred due to a discrepancy in the breakpoint settings between different Navbar variations (Navbar with Menu, Sticky, Static, Hide on Scroll). The Navbar with Menu was set to change its layout at the 'sm' breakpoint, while other Navbars were set to do so at the 'md' breakpoint.

The pull request aims to resolve this inconsistency and the clipping issue by adjusting the breakpoint for the Navbar with Menu to 'md', aligning it with the other Navbar types. This change ensures that the signup button remains visible and unclipped across different screen sizes and that the behavior of the Navbar with Menu is consistent with that of the other Navbar variations.

The description of the pull request provides a detailed account of the current and new behaviors, highlighting the problem with the signup button getting clipped at specific window sizes due to differing breakpoints. It also includes a screenshot demonstrating the fix applied to the Navbar, ensuring that the signup button is no longer clipped and that there is consistent behavior across all Navbar types.

Additionally, the linked issue provides further context, including screenshots of the problem, steps to reproduce the bug, and the expected behavior after the fix. It specifies the environment in which the bug was observed, including the operating system (Windows) and browser (Chrome), and mentions the version of NextUI affected by this issue (2.0.0).

### AI-Generated Summary of Generated Summaries

The pull request introduces a change in the NextUI library's Navbar component, specifically targeting the responsiveness and visual consistency of the signup button across different Navbar variations. By modifying the class name in the `NavbarContent` component from `hidden sm:flex` to `hidden md:flex`, the breakpoint at which the Navbar with Menu changes its layout is adjusted from 'sm' to 'md'. This alteration ensures that the signup button remains visible and unclipped at various screen sizes, aligning the behavior of the Navbar with Menu with that of other Navbar types such as Sticky, Static, and Hide on Scroll. The change addresses the issue reported in #2629, where the signup button was getting clipped in certain scenarios due to the inconsistent application of breakpoints across Navbar variations. The pull request effectively resolves this inconsistency, promoting a uniform user experience across different device sizes.

### Chat

There are 3 ways to chat with [CodeRabbit](https://coderabbit.ai):

- Review comments: Directly reply to a review comment made by CodeRabbit. Example:
	- `I pushed a fix in commit <commit_id>.`
	- `Generate unit testing code for this file.`
	- `Open a follow-up GitHub issue for this discussion.`
- Files and specific lines of code (under the "Files changed" tab): Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new review comment at the desired location with your query. Examples:
	- `@coderabbitai generate unit testing code for this file.`
	-	`@coderabbitai modularize this function.`
- PR comments: Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new PR comment to ask questions about the PR branch. For the best results, please provide a very specific query, as very limited context is provided in this mode. Examples:
	- `@coderabbitai generate interesting stats about this repository and render them as a table.`
	- `@coderabbitai show all the console.log statements in this repository.`
	- `@coderabbitai read src/utils.ts and generate unit testing code.`
	- `@coderabbitai read the files in the src/scheduler package and generate a class diagram using mermaid and a README in the markdown format.`

Note: Be mindful of the bot's finite context window. It's strongly recommended to break down tasks such as reading entire modules into smaller chunks. For a focused discussion, use review comments to chat about specific files and their changes, instead of using the PR comments.

### CodeRabbit Commands (invoked as PR comments)

- `@coderabbitai pause` to pause the reviews on a PR.
- `@coderabbitai resume` to resume the paused reviews.
- `@coderabbitai review` to trigger a review. This is useful when automatic reviews are disabled for the repository.
- `@coderabbitai resolve` resolve all the CodeRabbit review comments.
- `@coderabbitai help` to get help.


Additionally, you can add `@coderabbitai ignore` anywhere in the PR description to prevent this PR from being reviewed.
