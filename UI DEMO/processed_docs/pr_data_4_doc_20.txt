## AI-generated summary of changes

The diff introduces several modifications to the documentation of the Button component in the `apps/docs/content/docs/components/button.mdx` file. The primary changes include the addition of new props and events for the Button and ButtonGroup components, enhancing their functionality and customization options.

In the Button component's API section, two new properties are added to the props table: `ref`, which allows for forwarding a reference to the button element, and `type`, which specifies the native type of the button element (with options for `button`, `reset`, or `submit`). The default value for `type` is set to `button`. 

Additionally, the Button events section is updated to include detailed descriptions of various event handlers, such as `onPress`, `onPressStart`, `onPressEnd`, `onPressChange`, `onPressUp`, `onKeyDown`, `onKeyUp`, and `onClick`. Notably, the `onClick` event is marked as deprecated, with a recommendation to use `onPress` instead.

The ButtonGroup component's props table is also updated, with the default value for the `radius` attribute changed from `-` to `xl`. This change indicates a shift in the default styling for button groups.

Overall, these changes enhance the documentation by providing clearer guidance on the usage of the Button and ButtonGroup components, including new customization options and event handling capabilities.



## Alterations to the declarations of exported or public entities

- Method signature updated: `type` added to Button props in `apps/docs/content/docs/components/button.mdx`
- Method signature updated: `ref` added to Button props in `apps/docs/content/docs/components/button.mdx`
- Method signature updated: `radius` default value changed from `-` to `xl` in ButtonGroup props in `apps/docs/content/docs/components/button.mdx`

### Chat

There are 3 ways to chat with [CodeRabbit](https://coderabbit.ai):

- Review comments: Directly reply to a review comment made by CodeRabbit. Example:
  - `I pushed a fix in commit <commit_id>, please review it.`
  - `Generate unit testing code for this file.`
  - `Open a follow-up GitHub issue for this discussion.`
- Files and specific lines of code (under the "Files changed" tab): Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new review comment at the desired location with your query. Examples:
  - `@coderabbitai generate unit testing code for this file.`
  -	`@coderabbitai modularize this function.`
- PR comments: Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new PR comment to ask questions about the PR branch. For the best results, please provide a very specific query, as very limited context is provided in this mode. Examples:
  - `@coderabbitai gather interesting stats about this repository and render them as a table. Additionally, render a pie chart showing the language distribution in the codebase.`
  - `@coderabbitai read src/utils.ts and generate unit testing code.`
  - `@coderabbitai read the files in the src/scheduler package and generate a class diagram using mermaid and a README in the markdown format.`
  - `@coderabbitai help me debug CodeRabbit configuration file.`

Note: Be mindful of the bot's finite context window. It's strongly recommended to break down tasks such as reading entire modules into smaller chunks. For a focused discussion, use review comments to chat about specific files and their changes, instead of using the PR comments.

### CodeRabbit Commands (Invoked using PR comments)

- `@coderabbitai pause` to pause the reviews on a PR.
- `@coderabbitai resume` to resume the paused reviews.
- `@coderabbitai review` to trigger an incremental review. This is useful when automatic reviews are disabled for the repository.
- `@coderabbitai full review` to do a full review from scratch and review all the files again.
- `@coderabbitai summary` to regenerate the summary of the PR.
- `@coderabbitai resolve` resolve all the CodeRabbit review comments.
- `@coderabbitai configuration` to show the current CodeRabbit configuration for the repository.
- `@coderabbitai help` to get help.
