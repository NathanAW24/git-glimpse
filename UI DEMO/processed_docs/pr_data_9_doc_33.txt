Description:
Closes #1602
üìù Description
This PR contains 2 small changes:

Override odd selected row background color when isStriped is true (this used to stay the striped background color)
Differentiate a selected row from a striped row (these used to have the same bg color)

It is also my first PR in this repo, so please let me know if I'm missing something üòÅ
‚õ≥Ô∏è Current behavior (updates)


A row does not have a seperate background color when selected in case it's a striped row



The selected default background color is the same as the striped background color, which makes it hard to see which row is selected (especially when selectionMode is single). In this example, the last row is selected, but you cannot visually know:



üöÄ New behavior
Selected rows now always show the selected color, no matter if the row is striped or not

Also, the selected default background color is slightly brighter now

üí£ Is this a breaking change (Yes/No):
No
üìù Additional Information
I could not write a unit test for this as far as I'm aware, because I cannot get a before pseudo element in JavaScript. Would it be valuable to test if the td has a specific class? I'm willing to write that, but it felt wrong to test such implementation detail

## Walkthrough

The recent changes in the `table.ts` file within the `@nextui-org/theme` package address a bug related to the Table component's striped and color variants when using selection mode. Adjustments include reordering imports, modifying CSS class definitions, and adding compound variants for striped tables with different color themes to ensure proper coloring during selection. A patch differentiates the selected background color from the striped background color.

## PR Summary

**Title:** fix(table): differentiate selected bg color from striped bg color  
**User:** sjoerdvanBommel  
**Number:** 3221  

**Description:**  
This pull request addresses two main changes to the table component:

1. Overrides the odd selected row background color when `isStriped` is `true`, ensuring it does not remain the striped background color.
2. Differentiates the selected row background color from the striped row background color, making it easier to identify selected rows.

The current behavior shows no distinct background color for selected rows if they are striped, making it difficult to visually identify selected rows, especially in single selection mode. The new behavior ensures that selected rows always display the selected color, regardless of whether the row is striped. Additionally, the default selected background color is now slightly brighter.

This PR does not introduce any breaking changes. The author notes the difficulty in writing a unit test for this change due to the inability to access pseudo-elements in JavaScript and suggests testing if the `td` has a specific class as an alternative.

## Objectives from Linked Issues

**Issue #1602:**  
The issue describes a bug in the Table component where, when the table is set to striped and a color is added, the striped rows do not display the correct color when selected. The steps to reproduce the issue include adding a Table component with `selectionMode="multiple"`, `selectionBehavior="toggle"`, `color="primary"`, and `isStriped`. The expected behavior is that striped rows should also display the correct selected color, similar to non-striped rows. The issue was observed on Windows using Chrome.

<summary>Tips</summary>

### Chat

There are 3 ways to chat with [CodeRabbit](https://coderabbit.ai):

- Review comments: Directly reply to a review comment made by CodeRabbit. Example:
	- `I pushed a fix in commit <commit_id>.`
	- `Generate unit testing code for this file.`
	- `Open a follow-up GitHub issue for this discussion.`
- Files and specific lines of code (under the "Files changed" tab): Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new review comment at the desired location with your query. Examples:
	- `@coderabbitai generate unit testing code for this file.`
	-	`@coderabbitai modularize this function.`
- PR comments: Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new PR comment to ask questions about the PR branch. For the best results, please provide a very specific query, as very limited context is provided in this mode. Examples:
	- `@coderabbitai generate interesting stats about this repository and render them as a table.`
	- `@coderabbitai show all the console.log statements in this repository.`
	- `@coderabbitai read src/utils.ts and generate unit testing code.`
	- `@coderabbitai read the files in the src/scheduler package and generate a class diagram using mermaid and a README in the markdown format.`
	- `@coderabbitai help me debug CodeRabbit configuration file.`

Note: Be mindful of the bot's finite context window. It's strongly recommended to break down tasks such as reading entire modules into smaller chunks. For a focused discussion, use review comments to chat about specific files and their changes, instead of using the PR comments.

### CodeRabbit Commands (invoked as PR comments)

- `@coderabbitai pause` to pause the reviews on a PR.
- `@coderabbitai resume` to resume the paused reviews.
- `@coderabbitai review` to trigger an incremental review. This is useful when automatic reviews are disabled for the repository.
- `@coderabbitai full review` to do a full review from scratch and review all the files again.
- `@coderabbitai summary` to regenerate the summary of the PR.
- `@coderabbitai resolve` resolve all the CodeRabbit review comments.
- `@coderabbitai configuration` to show the current CodeRabbit configuration for the repository.
- `@coderabbitai help` to get help.


Additionally, you can add `@coderabbitai ignore` anywhere in the PR description to prevent this PR from being reviewed.

### CodeRabbit Configration File (`.coderabbit.yaml`)

- You can programmatically configure CodeRabbit by adding a `.coderabbit.yaml` file to the root of your repository.
- Please see the [configuration documentation](https://docs.coderabbit.ai/guides/configure-coderabbit) for more information.
- If your editor has YAML language server enabled, you can add the path at the top of this file to enable auto-completion and validation: `# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://coderabbit.ai/integrations/schema.v2.json`
