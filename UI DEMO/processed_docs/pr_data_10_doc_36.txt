Description:
Changes:
Impact:
This fix ensures that the pagination component accurately reflects the current state when triggering onChangeActivePage.

Closes # 
üìù Description
Add the onChangeActivePage function to the dependency array of the setPage useCallback hook to ensure it always reflects the latest state.
‚õ≥Ô∏è Current behavior (updates)
Currently, state is memoized during onChangeActivePage after page changes, meaning that writing onChangeActivePage handlers do not always contain current state. This was causing issues with hooks such as useSearchParams, where the search params would not be fully up-to-date
üöÄ New behavior
Adding onChangeActivePage to the callback dependencies ensures state is refreshed.
üí£ Is this a breaking change (Yes/No):
Should not break anything.
üìù Additional Information

## Walkthrough

The recent update to the `usePagination` hook in the `use-pagination` package involves adding the `onChangeActivePage` function as a dependency in the `useEffect` hook. This adjustment ensures that the page change event is triggered not only when the active page or total count changes but also when the `onChangeActivePage` function itself changes, enhancing the hook's reactivity and reliability.

packages/hooks/use-pagination/src/index.ts: ## Short Summary

The change in functionality involves adding `onChangeActivePage` as a dependency in the `useEffect` hook within the `usePagination` function in `packages/hooks/use-pagination/src/index.ts`. This change likely reflects a need to trigger a page change event when the active page or total count changes.

## Alterations to the declarations of exported or public entities

- `export function usePagination(props: UsePaginationProps)` in `packages/hooks/use-pagination/src/index.ts`
  - Before: Dependencies `[total, activePage]`
  - After: Dependencies `[total, activePage, onChangeActivePage]`

The current behavior memoizes state during `onChangeActivePage` after page changes, which causes issues with hooks like `useSearchParams`, where the search parameters are not fully up-to-date.

### AI-generated summary of generated summaries

The `usePagination` function in `packages/hooks/use-pagination/src/index.ts` has been updated to include `onChangeActivePage` as a dependency in its `useEffect` hook. Previously, the dependencies were `[total, activePage]`, but now they are `[total, activePage, onChangeActivePage]`. This modification ensures that the page change event is triggered not only when the active page or total count changes but also when the `onChangeActivePage` function changes.

### Alterations to the declarations of exported or public entities

- **`usePagination` function in `packages/hooks/use-pagination/src/index.ts`**:
  - **Before**: 
    ```typescript
    useEffect(() => {
      // Effect logic
    }, [total, activePage]);
    ```
  - **After**: 
    ```typescript
    useEffect(() => {
      // Effect logic
    }, [total, activePage, onChangeActivePage]);
    ```

### Chat

There are 3 ways to chat with [CodeRabbit](https://coderabbit.ai):

- Review comments: Directly reply to a review comment made by CodeRabbit. Example:
	- `I pushed a fix in commit <commit_id>.`
	- `Generate unit testing code for this file.`
	- `Open a follow-up GitHub issue for this discussion.`
- Files and specific lines of code (under the "Files changed" tab): Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new review comment at the desired location with your query. Examples:
	- `@coderabbitai generate unit testing code for this file.`
	-	`@coderabbitai modularize this function.`
- PR comments: Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new PR comment to ask questions about the PR branch. For the best results, please provide a very specific query, as very limited context is provided in this mode. Examples:
	- `@coderabbitai generate interesting stats about this repository and render them as a table.`
	- `@coderabbitai show all the console.log statements in this repository.`
	- `@coderabbitai read src/utils.ts and generate unit testing code.`
	- `@coderabbitai read the files in the src/scheduler package and generate a class diagram using mermaid and a README in the markdown format.`

Note: Be mindful of the bot's finite context window. It's strongly recommended to break down tasks such as reading entire modules into smaller chunks. For a focused discussion, use review comments to chat about specific files and their changes, instead of using the PR comments.

### CodeRabbit Commands (invoked as PR comments)

- `@coderabbitai pause` to pause the reviews on a PR.
- `@coderabbitai resume` to resume the paused reviews.
- `@coderabbitai review` to trigger a review. This is useful when automatic reviews are disabled for the repository.
- `@coderabbitai resolve` resolve all the CodeRabbit review comments.
- `@coderabbitai help` to get help.


Additionally, you can add `@coderabbitai ignore` anywhere in the PR description to prevent this PR from being reviewed.

### CodeRabbit Configration File (`.coderabbit.yaml`)

- You can programmatically configure CodeRabbit by adding a `.coderabbit.yaml` file to the root of your repository.
- Please see the [configuration documentation](https://docs.coderabbit.ai/guides/configure-coderabbit) for more information.
- If your editor has YAML language server enabled, you can add the path at the top of this file to enable auto-completion and validation: `# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://coderabbit.ai/integrations/schema.v2.json`
