Comments:
- jrgarciadev: Hey @Hexeption sorry for the delay, thanks a lot for your contribution, however due to [Sandpack](https://sandpack.codesandbox.io/) doesn't support a `next.js` template we can't import `NextLink` from `next/link`, we will solve this by changing the code editor in this specific example, thanks again üôåüèª \n
