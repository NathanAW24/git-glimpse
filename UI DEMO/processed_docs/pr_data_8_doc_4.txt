## Walkthrough

The changes involve modifying the `DateRangePicker` component to prevent errors when a date field's value is cleared. This is achieved by using optional chaining (`?.`) to handle `null` or `undefined` values when accessing the `start` property of the `value` object. Both the `presets.ts` file and the `date-range-picker.stories.tsx` file are updated to implement this solution.

## Summary of generated summaries

The changes made across the `date-range-picker` component and its associated storybook file involve updating the assignment of the `focusedValue` property to handle potential `null` or `undefined` values. Specifically, in the `presets.ts` file of the `date-range-picker` component, the `focusedValue` assignment within the `calendarProps` object has been modified to use optional chaining (`?.`) when accessing the `start` property of the `value` object. This same update has been applied to the `date-range-picker.stories.tsx` file in the `PresetsTemplate` function, ensuring that the assignment of `focusedValue` can safely handle cases where `value.start` might be `null`.

## Alterations to the declarations of exported or public entities

### `presets.ts` for `date-range-picker` component

- Before: `focusedValue: value.start`
- After: `focusedValue: value?.start`

### `date-range-picker.stories.tsx` for `date-range-picker` component

- Before: `focusedValue: value.start`
- After: `focusedValue: value?.start`

<summary>Tips</summary>

### Chat

There are 3 ways to chat with [CodeRabbit](https://coderabbit.ai):

- Review comments: Directly reply to a review comment made by CodeRabbit. Example:
	- `I pushed a fix in commit <commit_id>.`
	- `Generate unit testing code for this file.`
	- `Open a follow-up GitHub issue for this discussion.`
- Files and specific lines of code (under the "Files changed" tab): Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new review comment at the desired location with your query. Examples:
	- `@coderabbitai generate unit testing code for this file.`
	-	`@coderabbitai modularize this function.`
- PR comments: Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new PR comment to ask questions about the PR branch. For the best results, please provide a very specific query, as very limited context is provided in this mode. Examples:
	- `@coderabbitai generate interesting stats about this repository and render them as a table.`
	- `@coderabbitai show all the console.log statements in this repository.`
	- `@coderabbitai read src/utils.ts and generate unit testing code.`
	- `@coderabbitai read the files in the src/scheduler package and generate a class diagram using mermaid and a README in the markdown format.`
	- `@coderabbitai help me debug CodeRabbit configuration file.`

Note: Be mindful of the bot's finite context window. It's strongly recommended to break down tasks such as reading entire modules into smaller chunks. For a focused discussion, use review comments to chat about specific files and their changes, instead of using the PR comments.

### CodeRabbit Commands (invoked as PR comments)

- `@coderabbitai pause` to pause the reviews on a PR.
- `@coderabbitai resume` to resume the paused reviews.
- `@coderabbitai review` to trigger an incremental review. This is useful when automatic reviews are disabled for the repository.
- `@coderabbitai full review` to do a full review from scratch and review all the files again.
- `@coderabbitai summary` to regenerate the summary of the PR.
- `@coderabbitai resolve` resolve all the CodeRabbit review comments.
- `@coderabbitai configuration` to show the current CodeRabbit configuration for the repository.
- `@coderabbitai help` to get help.


Additionally, you can add `@coderabbitai ignore` anywhere in the PR description to prevent this PR from being reviewed.

### CodeRabbit Configration File (`.coderabbit.yaml`)

- You can programmatically configure CodeRabbit by adding a `.coderabbit.yaml` file to the root of your repository.
- Please see the [configuration documentation](https://docs.coderabbit.ai/guides/configure-coderabbit) for more information.
- If your editor has YAML language server enabled, you can add the path at the top of this file to enable auto-completion and validation: `# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://coderabbit.ai/integrations/schema.v2.json`
