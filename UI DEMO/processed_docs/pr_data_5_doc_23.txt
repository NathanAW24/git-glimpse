## Walkthrough

This pull request introduces a rollback of changes made in a previous pull request (PR3307) concerning the `@nextui-org/popover` and `@nextui-org/tooltip` packages. The rollback removes the `shouldBlockScroll` prop from the `FloatingComponents` and modifies scroll management in the `PopoverContent` component. Additionally, it integrates a new dependency, `react-remove-scroll`, to better handle scroll behavior when popovers are active. These adjustments aim to stabilize the current version while allowing for future improvements.

.changeset/fair-worms-reflect.md: ## AI-generated summary of changes

This change introduces a rollback for a previous pull request (PR3307) related to the packages `@nextui-org/popover` and `@nextui-org/tooltip`. The rollback indicates that the changes made in PR3307 will not be included in the current version and have been rescheduled for a future release, specifically version 2.5.0. This suggests that the modifications made in the earlier pull request may have introduced issues or were deemed premature for the current development cycle.

The rollback is a strategic decision to ensure stability in the current version while allowing for further refinement and testing of the features associated with the aforementioned packages before their eventual release. The change is documented in a new markdown file, which serves to communicate this decision clearly within the project's version control history.

apps/docs/components/marketing/hero/floating-components.tsx: ## AI-generated summary of changes

The diff indicates a modification in the `FloatingComponents` React functional component, specifically removing the `shouldBlockScroll` prop from a component that is presumably a tooltip or popover. This change alters the behavior of the component by allowing scrolling when the tooltip is open, as the prop previously controlled whether the scroll was blocked or not. The removal of this prop suggests a shift in how the component interacts with the surrounding UI, potentially improving user experience by allowing users to scroll while the tooltip is displayed.

## Alterations to the declarations of exported or public entities

- Removed: `shouldBlockScroll` prop from the component in `FloatingComponents` in `apps/docs/components/marketing/hero/floating-components.tsx`

---

packages/components/popover/package.json: ## AI-generated summary of changes

The diff introduces a new dependency, `react-remove-scroll`, with a version specification of `^2.5.6`, to the `dependencies` section of the `package.json` file for the `packages/components/popover` module. This addition enhances the functionality of the popover component by potentially allowing for better management of scroll behavior when the popover is active, improving user experience in scenarios where scroll management is critical. The existing dependency on `@react-types/overlays` remains unchanged. Overall, this change signifies an enhancement in the component's capabilities without altering any existing logic or functionality.

## Alterations to the declarations of exported or public entities

- Added: `"react-remove-scroll": "^2.5.6"` in `dependencies` of `package.json` in `packages/components/popover`

---

packages/components/popover/src/popover-content.tsx: ## AI-generated summary of changes

The changes in the `PopoverContent` component introduce a new feature that enhances the user experience by managing scroll behavior when the popover is open. Specifically, the `RemoveScroll` component from the `react-remove-scroll` library is integrated to conditionally block scrolling of the underlying content when the popover is active. This is controlled by the `shouldBlockScroll` and `isOpen` props, ensuring that when the popover is displayed, the user cannot scroll the background content, which can improve usability and focus on the popover content. Additionally, the rendering logic for the popover's contents has been modified to wrap the existing content rendering logic within the `RemoveScroll` component, maintaining the existing animation behavior while adding the new scroll management functionality.

The overall structure of the component remains intact, but the addition of scroll management introduces a significant change in how the popover interacts with the rest of the page, enhancing the overall functionality.

## Alterations to the declarations of exported or public entities

- Added: `isOpen` in `PopoverContentProps` in `packages/components/popover/src/popover-content.tsx`
- Added: `shouldBlockScroll` in `PopoverContentProps` in `packages/components/popover/src/popover-content.tsx`

---

packages/components/popover/src/use-popover.ts: ## AI-generated summary of changes

The diff indicates a modification in the `usePopover` function within the `use-popover.ts` file. The primary change involves the removal of the `usePreventScroll` hook, which was previously used to manage scroll prevention when the popover is open. This suggests a shift in how scroll behavior is handled during the popover's visibility, potentially allowing scrolling even when the popover is active, depending on the `shouldBlockScroll` condition. Additionally, the `shouldBlockScroll` property is now included in the returned object from the `usePopover` function, indicating that it may still be relevant for other logic or components that utilize this hook. Overall, these changes reflect a simplification of the popover's behavior regarding scroll management.

## Alterations to the declarations of exported or public entities

- Modified: `usePopover(originalProps: UsePopoverProps)` in `packages/components/popover/src/use-popover.ts` - Removed the use of `usePreventScroll` and added `shouldBlockScroll` to the returned object.

---

packages/components/tooltip/src/use-tooltip.ts: ## AI-generated summary of changes

The changes in the `use-tooltip.ts` file primarily involve the removal of the `shouldBlockScroll` property from the `Props` interface and its associated logic. This property, which previously controlled whether scrolling outside the tooltip should be blocked (defaulting to `true`), has been eliminated from both the interface and the implementation of the `useTooltip` function. Consequently, the call to `usePreventScroll` has also been removed, indicating that the tooltip will no longer manage scroll prevention based on this property. This alteration simplifies the tooltip's functionality by removing a feature that allowed for scroll blocking, potentially affecting how the tooltip interacts with the surrounding content when it is open.

## Alterations to the declarations of exported or public entities

- Removed: `shouldBlockScroll?: boolean;` in interface `Props` in `packages/components/tooltip/src/use-tooltip.ts` 
- Removed: `shouldBlockScroll = true,` in function `useTooltip(originalProps: UseTooltipProps)` in `packages/components/tooltip/src/use-tooltip.ts`

<summary>packages/components/popover/package.json (1)</summary><blockquote>

`59-60`: **LGTM!**

The addition of the `react-remove-scroll` dependency with version `^2.5.6` is a good enhancement to the popover component. It potentially allows for better management of scroll behavior when the popover is active, improving the user experience in scenarios where scroll management is critical.

The version specification `^2.5.6` is also a good practice as it allows for minor and patch updates to the dependency.

</blockquote></details>
<details>
<summary>packages/components/popover/src/popover-content.tsx (4)</summary><blockquote>

`6-6`: **LGTM!**

The import statement for the `RemoveScroll` component from the `react-remove-scroll` library is correctly written.

---

`27-27`: **LGTM!**

The additions of the `isOpen` and `shouldBlockScroll` props to the `PopoverContentProps` interface are necessary and correctly implemented.

- The `isOpen` prop is used to conditionally enable the `RemoveScroll` component based on the popover's open state.
- The `shouldBlockScroll` prop allows controlling whether scrolling should be blocked when the popover is open.



Also applies to: 32-32

---

`85-105`: **LGTM!**

The changes to the popover content rendering logic are correctly implemented and introduce the desired scroll management functionality.

- Wrapping the popover content with the `RemoveScroll` component allows managing the scroll behavior when the popover is open.
- Setting the `enabled` prop based on `shouldBlockScroll` and `isOpen` ensures that scrolling is blocked only when the popover is open and the `shouldBlockScroll` prop is `true`.
- Setting `removeScrollBar` to `false` prevents the scroll bar from being removed when scrolling is blocked.
- Maintaining the existing animation behavior ensures backward compatibility.

---

Line range hint `1-114`: **Excellent work!**

The changes to the `PopoverContent` component introduce a valuable new feature that enhances the user experience by managing scroll behavior when the popover is open. The integration of the `RemoveScroll` component from the `react-remove-scroll` library is done correctly and conditionally based on the `shouldBlockScroll` and `isOpen` props. The modifications to the rendering logic maintain the existing animation behavior while adding the new scroll management functionality. The changes are well-structured and do not introduce any breaking changes to the component's API.

Overall, this is a solid improvement to the `PopoverContent` component that will benefit users of the NextUI library. Great job!

`11-11`: **Removal of `usePreventScroll` from tooltip component is correct, but inconsistencies exist in the codebase.**

The `usePreventScroll` import and `shouldBlockScroll` property have been successfully removed from the tooltip component (`packages/components/tooltip/src/use-tooltip.ts`). This change is isolated and doesn't directly impact the tooltip's functionality.

However, it's important to note that:

- `usePreventScroll` is still used in `packages/hooks/use-aria-modal-overlay/src/index.ts`.
- `shouldBlockScroll` is used in multiple components, including popover, modal, and dropdown.

To ensure consistency across the codebase, consider:

1. Reviewing the scroll blocking functionality in all components.
2. Deciding on a unified approach for handling scroll blocking.
3. Updating other components if the removal of scroll blocking is intended to be a global change.

[observations]
- `shouldBlockScroll` is used in multiple files across different packages:
  1. dropdown/use-dropdown.ts
  2. modal/use-modal.ts
  3. hooks/use-aria-modal-overlay/index.ts
  4. popover/popover-content.tsx
  5. popover/use-popover.ts

- In most cases, it's defined as an optional boolean property.
- Default values vary: true for dropdown and modal, false for popover.
- It's used in conjunction with `RemoveScroll` component in popover-content.tsx.
- In the docs, there's an example where it's explicitly set to false.
[analysis]
- The `shouldBlockScroll` property is consistently used across multiple components (dropdown, modal, popover) and in a custom hook (use-aria-modal-overlay).
- Its usage in popover/use-popover.ts is consistent with other components, suggesting it's a standard pattern in the codebase.
- The property is likely used to control whether scrolling should be blocked when the component is open/active.
- The variation in default values (true for some components, false for popover) indicates that scroll blocking behavior is customized per component type.

**Verified: `shouldBlockScroll` is consistently used across components**

The addition of `shouldBlockScroll` to the `usePopover` hook aligns with existing patterns in the codebase. This property is used in multiple components (dropdown, modal, popover) and custom hooks to control scroll blocking behavior. Its implementation in the popover component is consistent with other uses, allowing for customizable scroll behavior when the popover is active.

Key observations:
- Used in dropdown, modal, and popover components
- Implemented in the `use-aria-modal-overlay` hook
- Default values vary by component (false for popover, true for others)
- Utilized with the `RemoveScroll` component in `popover-content.tsx`

This change enhances the consistency of the component API across the library.

### Chat

There are 3 ways to chat with [CodeRabbit](https://coderabbit.ai):

- Review comments: Directly reply to a review comment made by CodeRabbit. Example:
	- `I pushed a fix in commit <commit_id>.`
	- `Generate unit testing code for this file.`
	- `Open a follow-up GitHub issue for this discussion.`
- Files and specific lines of code (under the "Files changed" tab): Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new review comment at the desired location with your query. Examples:
	- `@coderabbitai generate unit testing code for this file.`
	-	`@coderabbitai modularize this function.`
- PR comments: Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new PR comment to ask questions about the PR branch. For the best results, please provide a very specific query, as very limited context is provided in this mode. Examples:
	- `@coderabbitai generate interesting stats about this repository and render them as a table.`
	- `@coderabbitai show all the console.log statements in this repository.`
	- `@coderabbitai read src/utils.ts and generate unit testing code.`
	- `@coderabbitai read the files in the src/scheduler package and generate a class diagram using mermaid and a README in the markdown format.`
	- `@coderabbitai help me debug CodeRabbit configuration file.`

Note: Be mindful of the bot's finite context window. It's strongly recommended to break down tasks such as reading entire modules into smaller chunks. For a focused discussion, use review comments to chat about specific files and their changes, instead of using the PR comments.

### CodeRabbit Commands (Invoked using PR comments)

- `@coderabbitai pause` to pause the reviews on a PR.
- `@coderabbitai resume` to resume the paused reviews.
- `@coderabbitai review` to trigger an incremental review. This is useful when automatic reviews are disabled for the repository.
- `@coderabbitai full review` to do a full review from scratch and review all the files again.
- `@coderabbitai summary` to regenerate the summary of the PR.
- `@coderabbitai resolve` resolve all the CodeRabbit review comments.
- `@coderabbitai configuration` to show the current CodeRabbit configuration for the repository.
- `@coderabbitai help` to get help.

### Other keywords and placeholders

- Add `@coderabbitai ignore` anywhere in the PR description to prevent this PR from being reviewed.
- Add `@coderabbitai summary` to generate the high-level summary at a specific location in the PR description.
- Add `@coderabbitai` anywhere in the PR title to generate the title automatically.
