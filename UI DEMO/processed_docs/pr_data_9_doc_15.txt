## Walkthrough

This update introduces a new section in the documentation that details the integration of the TanStack Router with NextUI. It provides practical examples for implementing the `NextUIProvider` in a root route and describes the use of the `navigate` and `useHref` props for routing and URL management. Additionally, it includes guidance on configuring TypeScript for autocompletion with the `href` prop, enhancing the clarity and usability of the routing setup for developers.

# New changesets

apps/docs/content/docs/guide/routing.mdx: ## AI-generated summary of changes

The diff introduces a new section detailing the integration of the TanStack Router with NextUI within a React application. Specifically, it adds instructions on how to utilize the `NextUIProvider` component to manage routing. The `RootRoute` function is defined, which utilizes the `useRouter` hook to access the router instance. The `NextUIProvider` is then rendered with two props: `navigate` and `useHref`. The `navigate` prop is set to a function that calls `router.navigate`, allowing navigation to different routes, while the `useHref` prop is configured to generate URLs using `router.buildLocation`. This change enhances the routing capabilities of the application by providing a seamless way to integrate routing with UI components, thereby improving the overall functionality and user experience.



## Alterations to the declarations of exported or public entities

- `function RootRoute()` in `app/root.tsx` ‚Üí `function RootRoute() { ... }` in `app/root.tsx` (new function added)

## PR Summary

The pull request titled "feat(docs): added tanstack router to the routing section in the documentation" was submitted by the user kuri-sun. It aims to enhance the documentation of the NextUI project by incorporating information about the TanStack router into the routing section.

Currently, the documentation does not include any references to the TanStack router. This update addresses that gap by adding relevant content to inform users about the TanStack router's usage and integration within the NextUI framework. 

The pull request does not introduce any breaking changes to the existing codebase. An accompanying screenshot illustrates the new documentation content, showcasing the addition visually. 

Overall, this PR contributes to improving the clarity and comprehensiveness of the routing documentation for users of the NextUI library.

### Chat

There are 3 ways to chat with [CodeRabbit](https://coderabbit.ai):

- Review comments: Directly reply to a review comment made by CodeRabbit. Example:
	- `I pushed a fix in commit <commit_id>.`
	- `Generate unit testing code for this file.`
	- `Open a follow-up GitHub issue for this discussion.`
- Files and specific lines of code (under the "Files changed" tab): Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new review comment at the desired location with your query. Examples:
	- `@coderabbitai generate unit testing code for this file.`
	-	`@coderabbitai modularize this function.`
- PR comments: Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new PR comment to ask questions about the PR branch. For the best results, please provide a very specific query, as very limited context is provided in this mode. Examples:
	- `@coderabbitai generate interesting stats about this repository and render them as a table.`
	- `@coderabbitai show all the console.log statements in this repository.`
	- `@coderabbitai read src/utils.ts and generate unit testing code.`
	- `@coderabbitai read the files in the src/scheduler package and generate a class diagram using mermaid and a README in the markdown format.`
	- `@coderabbitai help me debug CodeRabbit configuration file.`

Note: Be mindful of the bot's finite context window. It's strongly recommended to break down tasks such as reading entire modules into smaller chunks. For a focused discussion, use review comments to chat about specific files and their changes, instead of using the PR comments.

### CodeRabbit Commands (Invoked using PR comments)

- `@coderabbitai pause` to pause the reviews on a PR.
- `@coderabbitai resume` to resume the paused reviews.
- `@coderabbitai review` to trigger an incremental review. This is useful when automatic reviews are disabled for the repository.
- `@coderabbitai full review` to do a full review from scratch and review all the files again.
- `@coderabbitai summary` to regenerate the summary of the PR.
- `@coderabbitai resolve` resolve all the CodeRabbit review comments.
- `@coderabbitai configuration` to show the current CodeRabbit configuration for the repository.
- `@coderabbitai help` to get help.

### Other keywords and placeholders

- Add `@coderabbitai ignore` anywhere in the PR description to prevent this PR from being reviewed.
- Add `@coderabbitai summary` to generate the high-level summary at a specific location in the PR description.
- Add `@coderabbitai` anywhere in the PR title to generate the title automatically.

+To use [TanStack Router](https://tanstack.com/router/latest) with NextUI, render NextUI's RouterProvider inside your root route. Use `router.navigate` in the `navigate` prop, and `router.buildLocation` in the `useHref` prop.

+```tsx {9,10}
+// app/root.tsx
+import {NextUIProvider} from '@nextui-org/react';
