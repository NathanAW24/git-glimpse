### PR Objectives (User Provided Facts)

The pull request, numbered 2520, aims to address an issue with the documentation of the Tooltip component within a certain project. The core objective of this PR is to rectify misinformation in the documentation that could potentially lead to confusion among users or developers interacting with the Tooltip component. Specifically, the PR seeks to remove references to a non-existing property named `triggerType` from the Tooltip documentation. This action is taken in response to the discovery that the `triggerType` property does not actually exist within the Tooltip component's API, as highlighted in the linked issue #2518.

The PR is categorized under documentation (`docs`) and adheres to the guidelines for creating a Pull Request within the project. These guidelines include focusing the PR on a single type of change (in this case, documentation), keeping the PR as concise as possible, and avoiding the addition of new external dependencies to expedite the review process.

The description provided in the PR outlines the rationale behind the changes, stating that the removal of the `triggerType` props from the documentation is intended to eliminate any confusion that might arise from its mention, given that it is not a part of the Tooltip component's properties. The PR does not specify any updates to current behavior or introduce new behavior, as it strictly pertains to documentation. Furthermore, it clarifies that these changes do not constitute a breaking change, implying that the removal of the `triggerType` documentation will not affect the existing functionality or usage of the Tooltip component.

In summary, the primary objective of PR 2520 is to enhance the clarity and accuracy of the Tooltip component's documentation by removing references to a non-existent `triggerType` property, thereby preventing potential confusion and ensuring that the documentation accurately reflects the component's capabilities and properties.

### AI-Generated Summary of Generated Summaries

The pull request effectively removes references to the non-existent `triggerType` property from the Tooltip component's documentation. This change is aimed at clarifying the documentation and preventing confusion, ensuring that the properties and capabilities of the Tooltip component are accurately represented. The modification does not alter the component's current functionality or introduce new behavior, and it is confirmed to be non-breaking. The adjustment is strictly limited to the documentation, specifically within the Tooltip component's documentation file, enhancing its accuracy and reliability for users and developers.

### Chat

There are 3 ways to chat with CodeRabbit:

- Review comments: Directly reply to a review comment made by CodeRabbit. Example:
	- `I pushed a fix in commit <commit_id>.`
	- `Generate unit-tests for this file.`
	- `Open a follow-up GitHub issue for this discussion.`
- Files and specific lines of code (under the "Files changed" tab): Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new review comment at the desired location with your query. Examples:
	- `@coderabbitai generate unit tests for this file.`
	-	`@coderabbitai modularize this function.`
- PR comments: Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new PR comment to ask questions about the PR branch. For the best results, please provide a very specific query, as very limited context is provided in this mode. Examples:
	- `@coderabbitai generate interesting stats about this repository and render them as a table.`
	- `@coderabbitai show all the console.log statements in this repository.`
	- `@coderabbitai read src/utils.ts and generate unit tests.`
	- `@coderabbitai read the files in the src/scheduler package and generate a class diagram using mermaid and a README in the markdown format.`

Note: Be mindful of the bot's finite context window. It's strongly recommended to break down tasks such as reading entire modules into smaller chunks. For a focused discussion, use review comments to chat about specific files and their changes, instead of using the PR comments.
