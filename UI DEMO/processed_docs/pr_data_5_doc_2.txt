## PR Summary

The pull request titled "fix(docs): replace Twitter logo/links with X logo/links" was submitted by the user dgz9 and is identified as number 3815. The primary objective of this PR is to update all references to Twitter in the NextUI documentation to reflect the platform's rebranding to X (formerly Twitter).

The changes include replacing the old Twitter bird logo with the new X logo and updating all links from twitter.com to x.com. Additionally, the TwitterIcon component has been renamed to XIcon, and its SVG path has been modified to represent the new X logo.

Currently, the documentation features the old Twitter branding, which this PR aims to rectify. The proposed updates do not introduce any breaking changes to the existing functionality. There are no additional notes or information provided in the PR.

For further details, the pull request can be accessed at the following URL: [NextUI PR #3815](https://github.com/nextui-org/nextui/pull/3815).

## Comments Summary

In the comments section of the pull request, user dgz9 indicated their intention to remove the `TwitterIcon` component since it is no longer in use following the updates made in the PR. They sought clarification on whether to remove all references to Twitter or limit the changes to just the logo and links.

User wingkwong responded by clarifying that only the `TwitterIcon` in the `apps/docs/components/icons/social.tsx` file should be removed, as it has been replaced with the `XIcon`. They confirmed that `TwitterIcon` is not in use anymore, suggesting that the focus should remain on the necessary updates related to the rebranding without further alterations to other references.

dgz9 later mentioned that they had removed the `TwitterIcon` and changed a few more name references, even though they found it odd to have just "X" in some instances. They then confirmed that the pull request was ready for review and asked if any additional changes were needed.

Overall, the comments reflect a collaborative effort to ensure that the documentation accurately represents the new branding while maintaining clarity on the components being modified. The discussion indicates a focus on streamlining the documentation and ensuring that all references align with the recent rebranding of the platform.

### Chat

There are 3 ways to chat with [CodeRabbit](https://coderabbit.ai):

- Review comments: Directly reply to a review comment made by CodeRabbit. Example:
  - `I pushed a fix in commit <commit_id>, please review it.`
  - `Generate unit testing code for this file.`
  - `Open a follow-up GitHub issue for this discussion.`
- Files and specific lines of code (under the "Files changed" tab): Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new review comment at the desired location with your query. Examples:
  - `@coderabbitai generate unit testing code for this file.`
  -	`@coderabbitai modularize this function.`
- PR comments: Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new PR comment to ask questions about the PR branch. For the best results, please provide a very specific query, as very limited context is provided in this mode. Examples:
  - `@coderabbitai gather interesting stats about this repository and render them as a table. Additionally, render a pie chart showing the language distribution in the codebase.`
  - `@coderabbitai read src/utils.ts and generate unit testing code.`
  - `@coderabbitai read the files in the src/scheduler package and generate a class diagram using mermaid and a README in the markdown format.`
  - `@coderabbitai help me debug CodeRabbit configuration file.`

Note: Be mindful of the bot's finite context window. It's strongly recommended to break down tasks such as reading entire modules into smaller chunks. For a focused discussion, use review comments to chat about specific files and their changes, instead of using the PR comments.

### CodeRabbit Commands (Invoked using PR comments)

- `@coderabbitai pause` to pause the reviews on a PR.
- `@coderabbitai resume` to resume the paused reviews.
- `@coderabbitai review` to trigger an incremental review. This is useful when automatic reviews are disabled for the repository.
- `@coderabbitai full review` to do a full review from scratch and review all the files again.
- `@coderabbitai summary` to regenerate the summary of the PR.
- `@coderabbitai resolve` resolve all the CodeRabbit review comments.
- `@coderabbitai configuration` to show the current CodeRabbit configuration for the repository.
- `@coderabbitai help` to get help.

### Other keywords and placeholders

- Add `@coderabbitai ignore` anywhere in the PR description to prevent this PR from being reviewed.
- Add `@coderabbitai summary` to generate the high-level summary at a specific location in the PR description.
- Add `@coderabbitai` anywhere in the PR title to generate the title automatically.

\n- dgz9: > `TwitterIcon` can be removed since it's not in use.

Will do tonight.

Do you want me to remove all references of Twitter and replace with X or just keep it at the logo and links?\n- wingkwong: I mean just `TwitterIcon` in  `apps/docs/components/icons/social.tsx` since you replaced it with `XIcon`. `TwitterIcon` is not in use anymore.\n- dgz9: I was wondering about all the references to twitter, but I left it for now.

I removed the `TwitterIcon` and changed a few more name references (even though it looks weird as just X).\n- wingkwong: Is it ready for review or you still have further changes?\n- dgz9: Ready for review. Let me know if you want any other changes.\n- dgz9: Fixed light theme icon. Also noticed the feature grid icon was not working for light more, changed that too.\n
