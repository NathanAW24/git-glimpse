## Walkthrough

This update to the `@nextui-org/theme` package resolves an issue with the navbar's height when the `h-full` class is applied. It modifies the navbar's CSS to limit its height, preventing it from consuming excessive vertical space and enhancing the layout in full-height scenarios. This change directly addresses user-reported feedback on GitHub, leading to improved usability across different screen sizes.

.changeset/funny-mayflies-return.md: ## AI-generated summary of changes

This update introduces a patch to the `@nextui-org/theme` package, specifically addressing an issue related to the navbar height. The change resolves the problem of the navbar covering too much vertical space when the `h-full` class is applied. This improvement enhances the layout and usability of components that utilize this theme, ensuring that the navbar behaves correctly in full-height scenarios. The fix is linked to issue #1694 on GitHub, indicating that it is a response to user-reported feedback. Additionally, the CSS class definitions for the navbar component in the `navbar.ts` file have been modified, changing the height property from a flexible "h-auto" to a constrained "max-h-[var(--navbar-height)]". This alteration introduces a maximum height for the navbar, determined by a CSS variable `--navbar-height`, improving consistency across different screen sizes and content scenarios.

## PR Summary

The pull request titled "fix(navbar): height overflow when h-full" addresses an issue related to the navbar's height overflow over the main content in the NextUI framework. The problem was identified in issue #1694, where it was reported that the navbar, when set to a sticky position, still occupied space within the page. This behavior caused the page to become scrollable even when using full viewport dimensions (100vw and 100vh). 

The author, abhinandan-verma, has provided a solution that resolves the overflow issue, ensuring that the navbar does not interfere with the layout of the main content. The PR includes before-and-after screenshots to illustrate the changes made. The new behavior eliminates the unwanted scrolling effect caused by the navbar's height, thereby improving the overall user experience. The author confirms that this change is not a breaking change for existing NextUI users.

## Objectives from Linked Issues

The linked issue #1694 outlines the problem with the navbar's positioning in the NextUI framework. Users reported that when the navbar is set to a sticky position, it still takes up physical space on the page, leading to unintended scroll behavior when the page is designed to occupy the full width and height of the viewport. 

The objectives of the issue are to ensure that the navbar behaves correctly without causing the page to scroll unnecessarily. Users expect the navbar to remain fixed at the top of the viewport without affecting the layout of the main content beneath it. The issue emphasizes the need for a solution that allows the navbar to maintain its sticky functionality while preventing any overflow or scroll issues, thereby achieving a seamless user interface.

### Chat

There are 3 ways to chat with [CodeRabbit](https://coderabbit.ai):

- Review comments: Directly reply to a review comment made by CodeRabbit. Example:
	- `I pushed a fix in commit <commit_id>.`
	- `Generate unit testing code for this file.`
	- `Open a follow-up GitHub issue for this discussion.`
- Files and specific lines of code (under the "Files changed" tab): Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new review comment at the desired location with your query. Examples:
	- `@coderabbitai generate unit testing code for this file.`
	-	`@coderabbitai modularize this function.`
- PR comments: Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new PR comment to ask questions about the PR branch. For the best results, please provide a very specific query, as very limited context is provided in this mode. Examples:
	- `@coderabbitai generate interesting stats about this repository and render them as a table.`
	- `@coderabbitai show all the console.log statements in this repository.`
	- `@coderabbitai read src/utils.ts and generate unit testing code.`
	- `@coderabbitai read the files in the src/scheduler package and generate a class diagram using mermaid and a README in the markdown format.`
	- `@coderabbitai help me debug CodeRabbit configuration file.`

Note: Be mindful of the bot's finite context window. It's strongly recommended to break down tasks such as reading entire modules into smaller chunks. For a focused discussion, use review comments to chat about specific files and their changes, instead of using the PR comments.

- `@coderabbitai summary` to regenerate the summary of the PR.
- `@coderabbitai resolve` resolve all the CodeRabbit review comments.
- `@coderabbitai configuration` to show the current CodeRabbit configuration for the repository.

\n- wingkwong: 1. why do you set `h-full` for that?
2. how does this PR solve the issue? The issue is saying the page is scrollable when setting the page 100vw and 100vh. The changes you made and the demo you showed are not quite related to the reported issue.

i would suggest to ask for user to provide the reproducible env first. \n- awesome-pro: @wingkwong  sir even the `100vh` and  `100vw` has same issue. 
I don't believe any user would like such a navbar covering the whole screen content


https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/92255a67-fa9d-4845-b3c8-838b66b1e5a3

\n- wingkwong: can you share a sandbox instead? it looks different on my side. from the screenshot you showed in new behaviour, it also contains a scrollbar which is already not expected.\n- awesome-pro: @wingkwong  You can easily reproduce the bug using the NextUI Template and editing the `navbar.tsx`  like this 

```bash
 <NextUINavbar maxWidth="xl" position="sticky" >
```
to 

```bash
 <NextUINavbar maxWidth="xl" position="sticky" className="w-screen h-screen">
```

or simply in storybook

by changing this [line](https://github.com/nextui-org/nextui/blob/canary/packages/components/navbar/stories/navbar.stories.tsx#L103)

by. 
```zsh
   <Navbar {...args} parentRef={parentRef} classname="h-screen w-screen" >
```
then see the story \n- wingkwong: The issue is talking about the page being set to 100vw and 100vh, not the navbar itself. Setting full height & width screen to navbar doesn't make any sense.\n- wingkwong: Closing - not applicable\n
