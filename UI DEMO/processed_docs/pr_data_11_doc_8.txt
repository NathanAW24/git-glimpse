## Walkthrough

The recent changes in two files involve a consistent update in the CSS class naming convention from `"height-auto"` to `"h-auto"`. This alteration, applied to card components in both instances, indicates a shift towards a more concise and standardized approach to class names, potentially improving clarity and reducing redundancy in managing the height property of these elements.

### PR Objectives

The pull request (PR) number 2968 is titled "fix(theme): fixed class name from 'height-auto' to 'h-auto'". The main objective of this PR is to correct a specific class name used within the project's theme components. The class name being changed is from "height-auto" to "h-auto". This change is applied to two specific files within the project:

1. `packages/core/system-rsc/test-utils/slots-component.tsx`
2. `packages/core/theme/src/components/card.ts`

The PR description indicates that this change is a simple fix, not expected to introduce any breaking changes to existing users of the NextUI framework. The PR adheres to the guidelines of keeping changes small and limited to one type, in this case, a bugfix. There is no mention of new external dependencies or other types of changes such as features or refactoring.

### AI-Generated Summary of Generated Summaries

The pull request makes a consistent update across two files within the NextUI project, specifically targeting the class name used for styling components related to height management. In both instances, the class name "height-auto" has been updated to "h-auto". This change affects:

- A `card` element in the `slots-component.tsx` file located under `packages/core/system-rsc/test-utils`.
- A card component in the `card.ts` file located under `packages/core/theme/src/components`.

This modification is likely aimed at standardizing the CSS class naming convention across the project, possibly aligning with a broader styling framework or internal guidelines that prefer shorthand CSS class names.

### Alterations to the Declarations of Exported or Public Entities

**File: `packages/core/system-rsc/test-utils/slots-component.tsx`**
- **Before Change:**
  ```typescript
  const cardClassName = "some-other-class height-auto";
  ```
- **After Change:**
  ```typescript
  const cardClassName = "some-other-class h-auto";
  ```

**File: `packages/core/theme/src/components/card.ts`**
- **Before Change:**
  ```typescript
  const cardClassName = "some-other-class height-auto";
  ```
- **After Change:**
  ```typescript
  const cardClassName = "some-other-class h-auto";
  ```

In both files, the only change made is the replacement of the class name "height-auto" with "h-auto" in the string that assigns classes to card components. There are no changes to the structure or functionality of the components themselves, nor are there any changes to the parameters, return types, or other aspects of the functions or components.

<summary>Tips</summary>

### Chat

There are 3 ways to chat with [CodeRabbit](https://coderabbit.ai):

- Review comments: Directly reply to a review comment made by CodeRabbit. Example:
	- `I pushed a fix in commit <commit_id>.`
	- `Generate unit testing code for this file.`
	- `Open a follow-up GitHub issue for this discussion.`
- Files and specific lines of code (under the "Files changed" tab): Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new review comment at the desired location with your query. Examples:
	- `@coderabbitai generate unit testing code for this file.`
	-	`@coderabbitai modularize this function.`
- PR comments: Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new PR comment to ask questions about the PR branch. For the best results, please provide a very specific query, as very limited context is provided in this mode. Examples:
	- `@coderabbitai generate interesting stats about this repository and render them as a table.`
	- `@coderabbitai show all the console.log statements in this repository.`
	- `@coderabbitai read src/utils.ts and generate unit testing code.`
	- `@coderabbitai read the files in the src/scheduler package and generate a class diagram using mermaid and a README in the markdown format.`

Note: Be mindful of the bot's finite context window. It's strongly recommended to break down tasks such as reading entire modules into smaller chunks. For a focused discussion, use review comments to chat about specific files and their changes, instead of using the PR comments.

### CodeRabbit Commands (invoked as PR comments)

- `@coderabbitai pause` to pause the reviews on a PR.
- `@coderabbitai resume` to resume the paused reviews.
- `@coderabbitai review` to trigger a review. This is useful when automatic reviews are disabled for the repository.
- `@coderabbitai resolve` resolve all the CodeRabbit review comments.
- `@coderabbitai help` to get help.


Additionally, you can add `@coderabbitai ignore` anywhere in the PR description to prevent this PR from being reviewed.

### CodeRabbit Configration File (`.coderabbit.yaml`)

- You can programmatically configure CodeRabbit by adding a `.coderabbit.yaml` file to the root of your repository.
- Please see the [configuration documentation](https://docs.coderabbit.ai/guides/configure-coderabbit) for more information.
- If your editor has YAML language server enabled, you can add the path at the top of this file to enable auto-completion and validation: `# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://coderabbit.ai/integrations/schema.v2.json`
