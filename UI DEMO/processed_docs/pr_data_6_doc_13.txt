## Walkthrough

The recent updates to the documentation enhance the presentation of CLI commands for various package managers. By replacing traditional code blocks with the `<PackageManagers>` component, the documentation now offers a clearer, more organized, and visually appealing format. This modular approach improves user experience and maintainability, ensuring that installation and command usage instructions are easy to follow across npm, yarn, pnpm, and bun.

apps/docs/content/docs/guide/cli.mdx: ## AI-generated summary of changes

The diff introduces significant modifications to the documentation of the CLI commands, enhancing the clarity and usability of the instructions. The previous text-based command examples have been replaced with a structured `<PackageManagers>` component that organizes the commands for various package managers (npm, yarn, pnpm, bun) in a more visually appealing and consistent format. This change improves the presentation of commands, making it easier for users to understand and execute the instructions without ambiguity. The updates also ensure that the commands are clearly delineated for each package manager, facilitating a smoother user experience when installing and running the CLI. Overall, these adjustments reflect a shift towards a more modular and maintainable documentation approach.

apps/docs/content/docs/guide/installation.mdx: ## AI-generated summary of changes

The diff introduces a significant update to the way installation commands are presented in the documentation for setting up a NextUI project. Instead of using plain code blocks for the installation commands, the changes replace these blocks with a new component, `<PackageManagers>`, which encapsulates the commands for various package managers (npm, yarn, pnpm, and bun). This change enhances the structure and readability of the documentation by standardizing the presentation of commands across different package managers. The commands for installing dependencies and starting the local server are now rendered through this component, which likely improves maintainability and potentially allows for additional functionality in the future, such as automatic updates or improved styling.

The overall flow of the installation instructions remains intact, but the method of displaying commands is now more dynamic and organized, allowing users to see all package manager options in a consistent format. This change reflects a shift towards a more modular approach in documentation, which can facilitate easier updates and enhancements over time.

### Chat

There are 3 ways to chat with [CodeRabbit](https://coderabbit.ai):

- Review comments: Directly reply to a review comment made by CodeRabbit. Example:
	- `I pushed a fix in commit <commit_id>.`
	- `Generate unit testing code for this file.`
	- `Open a follow-up GitHub issue for this discussion.`
- Files and specific lines of code (under the "Files changed" tab): Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new review comment at the desired location with your query. Examples:
	- `@coderabbitai generate unit testing code for this file.`
	-	`@coderabbitai modularize this function.`
- PR comments: Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new PR comment to ask questions about the PR branch. For the best results, please provide a very specific query, as very limited context is provided in this mode. Examples:
	- `@coderabbitai generate interesting stats about this repository and render them as a table.`
	- `@coderabbitai show all the console.log statements in this repository.`
	- `@coderabbitai read src/utils.ts and generate unit testing code.`
	- `@coderabbitai read the files in the src/scheduler package and generate a class diagram using mermaid and a README in the markdown format.`
	- `@coderabbitai help me debug CodeRabbit configuration file.`

Note: Be mindful of the bot's finite context window. It's strongly recommended to break down tasks such as reading entire modules into smaller chunks. For a focused discussion, use review comments to chat about specific files and their changes, instead of using the PR comments.

### CodeRabbit Commands (invoked as PR comments)

- `@coderabbitai pause` to pause the reviews on a PR.
- `@coderabbitai resume` to resume the paused reviews.
- `@coderabbitai review` to trigger an incremental review. This is useful when automatic reviews are disabled for the repository.
- `@coderabbitai full review` to do a full review from scratch and review all the files again.
- `@coderabbitai summary` to regenerate the summary of the PR.
- `@coderabbitai resolve` resolve all the CodeRabbit review comments.
- `@coderabbitai configuration` to show the current CodeRabbit configuration for the repository.
- `@coderabbitai help` to get help.


Additionally, you can add `@coderabbitai ignore` anywhere in the PR description to prevent this PR from being reviewed.

### CodeRabbit Configuration File (`.coderabbit.yaml`)

- You can programmatically configure CodeRabbit by adding a `.coderabbit.yaml` file to the root of your repository.
- Please see the [configuration documentation](https://docs.coderabbit.ai/guides/configure-coderabbit) for more information.
- If your editor has YAML language server enabled, you can add the path at the top of this file to enable auto-completion and validation: `# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://coderabbit.ai/integrations/schema.v2.json`
