‚õ≥Ô∏è Current behavior (updates)
When entering text in a modal form using Korean, pressing the tab key causes the last character to be entered into the next input field.
üöÄ New behavior
Pressing the tab key after entering text in Korean no longer transfers the last character to the next input field.
üí£ Is this a breaking change (Yes/No):
No.
üìù Additional Information
This bug does not occur in Storybook, so the behavior was verified using the docs.
This was tested using both Japanese and 2-set Korean IMEs on browsers including Chrome, Safari, and Firefox.

### PR Objectives

This pull request, numbered 2709 and titled "Fix(modal): input carry over with IMEs in modal forms," addresses an issue in the NextUI library where typing with an IME, such as Korean or Japanese, and pressing the tab key would carry the input to the next field in modal forms. The problem, documented in issue #2445, led to the last character being unintentionally transferred to the subsequent input field, impacting user interaction negatively.

The resolution involves utilizing the `isComposing` property from the `KeyboardEvent` API to distinguish input events during composition sessions, like those with IMEs. By leveraging this property, the code now correctly handles tab key presses, preventing the default behavior that caused character carryover.

The changes are isolated to the `ModalContent` component within the NextUI library. A new `onKeyDown` callback has been incorporated to manage keyboard events and address the tab key behavior during text input with IMEs. This enhancement ensures that pressing the tab key post-IME input no longer results in transferring the last character to the subsequent input field.

Additionally, a changeset file has been included to outline the fix for preventing IME input carryover in modal form fields during tab navigation. Extensive testing across Chrome, Safari, and Firefox, with Japanese and Korean IMEs, confirms consistent behavior across browsers and input methods.

### AI-Generated Summary of Changes

The PR introduces a patch in the NextUI library's `ModalContent` component to handle keyboard events more effectively when using IMEs, specifically addressing the issue of character carryover when tabbing in modal input fields. By adding an `onKeyDown` callback, the default tab behavior causing character transfer has been mitigated, ensuring a seamless user experience for non-Latin script users navigating form fields with the tab key.

### Chat

There are 3 ways to chat with [CodeRabbit](https://coderabbit.ai):

- Review comments: Directly reply to a review comment made by CodeRabbit. Example:
	- `I pushed a fix in commit <commit_id>.`
	- `Generate unit testing code for this file.`
	- `Open a follow-up GitHub issue for this discussion.`
- Files and specific lines of code (under the "Files changed" tab): Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new review comment at the desired location with your query. Examples:
	- `@coderabbitai generate unit testing code for this file.`
	-	`@coderabbitai modularize this function.`
- PR comments: Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new PR comment to ask questions about the PR branch. For the best results, please provide a very specific query, as very limited context is provided in this mode. Examples:
	- `@coderabbitai generate interesting stats about this repository and render them as a table.`
	- `@coderabbitai show all the console.log statements in this repository.`
	- `@coderabbitai read src/utils.ts and generate unit testing code.`
	- `@coderabbitai read the files in the src/scheduler package and generate a class diagram using mermaid and a README in the markdown format.`

Note: Be mindful of the bot's finite context window. It's strongly recommended to break down tasks such as reading entire modules into smaller chunks. For a focused discussion, use review comments to chat about specific files and their changes, instead of using the PR comments.

### CodeRabbit Commands (invoked as PR comments)

- `@coderabbitai resolve` resolve all the CodeRabbit review comments.
- `@coderabbitai help` to get help.
