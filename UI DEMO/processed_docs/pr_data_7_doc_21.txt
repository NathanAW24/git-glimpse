## PR Summary

**Title:** fix(table): sortable header slow color change during theme change  
**User:** abhinandan-verma  
**Number:** 3491  
**URL:** [https://github.com/nextui-org/nextui/pull/3491](https://github.com/nextui-org/nextui/pull/3491)  
**Description:**  
This pull request addresses the issue of slow color change in sortable table headers during a theme change. The solution involves removing the `transition-colors` CSS property to fix the slow color change. The current behavior shows a noticeable delay in color transition when switching themes, which is demonstrated in the provided video links. The new behavior, after the fix, shows a more immediate color change without the delay. This change is not a breaking change.

## Objectives from Linked Issues

**Linked Issue:** [#3488](https://github.com/nextui-org/nextui/issues/3488)  
**Title:** [BUG] - Table Sort Headers flicker when switching between light and dark theme  
**Description:**  
The issue describes a bug in NextUI version 2.3.6 where the headers of sortable columns in a table flicker when switching between light and dark themes. The flicker is visible in the attached video. The steps to reproduce the bug include using a NextUI table, making a column sortable, and switching themes using a theme switcher. The expected behavior is for the theme to change smoothly without flickering, similar to other theme changes in the UI. The issue was observed on macOS using the Chrome browser.

### Chat

There are 3 ways to chat with [CodeRabbit](https://coderabbit.ai):

- Review comments: Directly reply to a review comment made by CodeRabbit. Example:
	- `I pushed a fix in commit <commit_id>.`
	- `Generate unit testing code for this file.`
	- `Open a follow-up GitHub issue for this discussion.`
- Files and specific lines of code (under the "Files changed" tab): Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new review comment at the desired location with your query. Examples:
	- `@coderabbitai generate unit testing code for this file.`
	-	`@coderabbitai modularize this function.`
- PR comments: Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new PR comment to ask questions about the PR branch. For the best results, please provide a very specific query, as very limited context is provided in this mode. Examples:
	- `@coderabbitai generate interesting stats about this repository and render them as a table.`
	- `@coderabbitai show all the console.log statements in this repository.`
	- `@coderabbitai read src/utils.ts and generate unit testing code.`
	- `@coderabbitai read the files in the src/scheduler package and generate a class diagram using mermaid and a README in the markdown format.`
	- `@coderabbitai help me debug CodeRabbit configuration file.`

Note: Be mindful of the bot's finite context window. It's strongly recommended to break down tasks such as reading entire modules into smaller chunks. For a focused discussion, use review comments to chat about specific files and their changes, instead of using the PR comments.

### CodeRabbit Commands (invoked as PR comments)

- `@coderabbitai pause` to pause the reviews on a PR.
- `@coderabbitai resume` to resume the paused reviews.
- `@coderabbitai review` to trigger an incremental review. This is useful when automatic reviews are disabled for the repository.
- `@coderabbitai full review` to do a full review from scratch and review all the files again.
- `@coderabbitai summary` to regenerate the summary of the PR.
- `@coderabbitai resolve` resolve all the CodeRabbit review comments.
- `@coderabbitai configuration` to show the current CodeRabbit configuration for the repository.
- `@coderabbitai help` to get help.


Additionally, you can add `@coderabbitai ignore` anywhere in the PR description to prevent this PR from being reviewed.

### CodeRabbit Configuration File (`.coderabbit.yaml`)

- You can programmatically configure CodeRabbit by adding a `.coderabbit.yaml` file to the root of your repository.
- Please see the [configuration documentation](https://docs.coderabbit.ai/guides/configure-coderabbit) for more information.
- If your editor has YAML language server enabled, you can add the path at the top of this file to enable auto-completion and validation: `# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://coderabbit.ai/integrations/schema.v2.json`
