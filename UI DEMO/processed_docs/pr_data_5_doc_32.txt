## Walkthrough
The changes involve modifications to the `blurred.ts` file, where a new `div` element has been added to wrap the `Card` component, introducing a gradient background. Additionally, the documentation for the `isBlurred` prop has been updated to clarify its dependency on the parent component for the blurring effect. The internal structure of the `Card` component and its functionality remain unchanged.

apps/docs/content/components/card/blurred.ts: ## AI-generated summary of changes

The diff reflects a modification in the structure of the `App` component within the `blurred.ts` file. The primary change involves the addition of a new `div` element that wraps the existing `Card` component, introducing a gradient background. This new `div` enhances the visual presentation of the card by providing a more dynamic background effect. The internal structure of the `Card` and its child components remains largely unchanged, with the same elements retained, including the `CardBody`, `Image`, and various `Button` components. The overall layout and functionality of the component are preserved, but the visual styling is enhanced through the addition of the gradient wrapper. The control flow and state management, particularly the `liked` state and its toggling mechanism, remain intact.

## Alterations to the declarations of exported or public entities

- No changes to the declarations of exported or public entities were made in `apps/docs/content/components/card/blurred.ts`.

apps/docs/content/docs/components/card.mdx: ## AI-generated summary of changes

The documentation for the Card component has been updated to clarify the functionality of the `isBlurred` prop. It now specifies that the blur effect is dependent on the properties of its ancestor element. Furthermore, a note has been added to guide users on achieving the blur effect by providing a suitable background to a parent element of the Card component. An example is included, recommending the use of a gradient background to enhance the visibility of the Card's blur effect.

## PR Summary

The pull request titled "refactor(docs): example of blurred card" was submitted by the user macci001 and is identified as PR number 3741. This PR addresses an issue related to the documentation of the blurred card feature in the NextUI library, specifically aiming to resolve confusion regarding the implementation of the blurred card example. The current documentation did not clarify that users needed to add a background to the parent or ancestor element to achieve the desired blurred effect. The new documentation updates include information on how to add a gradient background, enabling users to recreate the blurred card effect correctly. The PR does not introduce any breaking changes.

## Objectives from Linked Issues

The linked issue titled "[BUG] - Card - Blurred Card not effective" (issue number #3717) describes a bug concerning the `isBlurred` attribute in the NextUI library. The issue was reported by a user who observed that the `isBlurred` property was not functioning as expected in the official demo code. A link to the demo code hosted on CodeSandbox was provided, where the problem could be replicated. The expected behavior was for the `isBlurred` property to work correctly, allowing users to effectively utilize the blurred card feature. The issue was reported on a mac operating system using the Chrome browser. The objective of the linked issue is to ensure that the `isBlurred` attribute operates as intended, thereby enhancing the usability of the blurred card feature in the NextUI library.

## Comments Summary

In the comments section of the pull request, the user macci001 acknowledged the proposed changes and expressed agreement with the rationale behind them. They suggested that to avoid duplication, it would be more efficient to add a note in the documentation rather than wrapping the example code in a parent component. This indicates a collaborative approach to improving the documentation while maintaining clarity for users.

The discussion reflects a focus on enhancing the user experience by ensuring that the documentation accurately represents the functionality of the blurred card feature. By modifying the example to be workable, the PR aims to eliminate confusion and provide users with a clear understanding of how to implement the `isBlurred` property effectively.

Overall, the comments highlight a constructive dialogue between contributors, emphasizing the importance of clear documentation in software development. The suggestion to add a note rather than duplicating code demonstrates a thoughtful consideration of best practices in documentation and code maintenance. This approach not only addresses the immediate issue but also contributes to the long-term quality of the NextUI library's documentation.

### Chat

There are 3 ways to chat with [CodeRabbit](https://coderabbit.ai):

- Review comments: Directly reply to a review comment made by CodeRabbit. Example:
  - `I pushed a fix in commit <commit_id>, please review it.`
  - `Generate unit testing code for this file.`
  - `Open a follow-up GitHub issue for this discussion.`
- Files and specific lines of code (under the "Files changed" tab): Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new review comment at the desired location with your query. Examples:
  - `@coderabbitai generate unit testing code for this file.`
  -	`@coderabbitai modularize this function.`
- PR comments: Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new PR comment to ask questions about the PR branch. For the best results, please provide a very specific query, as very limited context is provided in this mode. Examples:
  - `@coderabbitai gather interesting stats about this repository and render them as a table. Additionally, render a pie chart showing the language distribution in the codebase.`
  - `@coderabbitai read src/utils.ts and generate unit testing code.`
  - `@coderabbitai read the files in the src/scheduler package and generate a class diagram using mermaid and a README in the markdown format.`
  - `@coderabbitai help me debug CodeRabbit configuration file.`

Note: Be mindful of the bot's finite context window. It's strongly recommended to break down tasks such as reading entire modules into smaller chunks. For a focused discussion, use review comments to chat about specific files and their changes, instead of using the PR comments.
