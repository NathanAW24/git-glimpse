### PR Objectives (User Provided Facts)

This Pull Request (PR) titled "fix(table striped): isStriped prop fix for multiple computed values in `td`" with the number 2509 aims to address a specific rendering issue in the `Table` component of the NextUI library. The problem, as detailed in the PR description and the linked issue #2506, involves the `Table` component incorrectly rendering cell contents beneath the stripe when the `isStriped` prop is used in conjunction with multiple computed values within a `td` element. This behavior deviates from the expected, where cell contents should be displayed above the stripe, maintaining the visual integrity of the striped table design.

The issue was reproduced in NextUI version 2.2.8, on Ubuntu 23.04 operating system and Chrome browser. It specifically affects tables that utilize the `isStriped` prop and contain cells with more than one computed value. The problem was visually documented in the linked GitHub issue, showing the current incorrect display alongside the expected correct display.

The PR introduces a fix that corrects the rendering order, ensuring that the contents of the cell are displayed above the stripe for rows with multiple computed values. This is achieved through a modification in the `table.ts` file within the NextUI library's core theme components. A new CSS class `group-data-[odd=true]:before:-z-10` is added, which appears to adjust the z-index for odd rows, thereby correcting the layering of cell contents and stripe backgrounds.

The PR is categorized as a bug fix and does not introduce any breaking changes or require additional information beyond the description of the fix itself. The objective of this PR is to enhance the visual consistency and correctness of the `Table` component's striped pattern, especially in cases where cells contain complex, computed values.

### AI-Generated Summary of Generated Summaries

The Pull Request (PR) #2509 addresses a rendering issue in the NextUI library's `Table` component, where cell contents were incorrectly displayed beneath the stripe for rows with multiple computed values when the `isStriped` prop was used. This issue was documented in issue #2506 and was observed in NextUI version 2.2.8 on Ubuntu 23.04 with Chrome browser. The fix involves a modification to the `table.ts` file within the library's core theme components, specifically adding a new CSS class `group-data-[odd=true]:before:-z-10`. This class adjustment corrects the z-index for odd rows, ensuring that cell contents are correctly rendered above the stripe, aligning with the expected visual behavior for striped tables. The PR successfully resolves the visual discrepancy without introducing any breaking changes, thereby improving the visual integrity and user experience of the `Table` component in scenarios involving complex, computed cell values.

### Chat

There are 3 ways to chat with CodeRabbit:

- Review comments: Directly reply to a review comment made by CodeRabbit. Example:
	- `I pushed a fix in commit <commit_id>.`
	- `Generate unit-tests for this file.`
	- `Open a follow-up GitHub issue for this discussion.`
- Files and specific lines of code (under the "Files changed" tab): Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new review comment at the desired location with your query. Examples:
	- `@coderabbitai generate unit tests for this file.`
	-	`@coderabbitai modularize this function.`
- PR comments: Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new PR comment to ask questions about the PR branch. For the best results, please provide a very specific query, as very limited context is provided in this mode. Examples:
	- `@coderabbitai generate interesting stats about this repository and render them as a table.`
	- `@coderabbitai show all the console.log statements in this repository.`
	- `@coderabbitai read src/utils.ts and generate unit tests.`
	- `@coderabbitai read the files in the src/scheduler package and generate a class diagram using mermaid and a README in the markdown format.`

Note: Be mindful of the bot's finite context window. It's strongly recommended to break down tasks such as reading entire modules into smaller chunks. For a focused discussion, use review comments to chat about specific files and their changes, instead of using the PR comments.
