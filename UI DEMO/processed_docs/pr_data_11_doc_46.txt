## Walkthrough
The recent changes involve a patch to the `@nextui-org/ripple` package, primarily addressing an issue with the press event on iOS devices. This update includes adjustments to the `zIndex` property of the Ripple component to modify its stacking order and a correction in the calculation of `x` and `y` coordinates within the `useRipple` function to improve positioning accuracy.

.changeset/wicked-panthers-relax.md: The new file introduces a patch for the `@nextui-org/ripple` package to fix the press event issue on iOS caused by the ripple zIndex.

---

packages/components/ripple/src/ripple.tsx: 
## Short Summary

In the `Ripple` component in `ripple.tsx`, the `zIndex` property was changed from `10` to `0`, potentially affecting the stacking order of the ripple effect.

## Short summary

In the `useRipple` function within `use-ripple.ts`, the calculation for the `x` and `y` coordinates has been adjusted to use `rect.left` and `rect.top` instead of `rect.x` and `rect.y`, respectively.

### PR Objectives

The pull request titled "fix(ripple): z-index adjusted" with the number 2853 aims to address an issue in the `@nextui-org/ripple` package. The description and the linked issues are not explicitly detailed in the provided text, but the changes suggest a focus on modifying the z-index property of the ripple effect in the UI component to correct a specific behavior, potentially related to stacking order issues.

The primary objective of this PR appears to be the adjustment of the z-index within the Ripple component to ensure correct rendering and interaction, particularly on iOS devices where a press event issue was noted. The changes are confined to the Ripple component, indicating a targeted fix rather than a broad modification of the library or its dependencies.

### AI-Generated Summary of Generated Summaries

The pull request introduces two main changes to the `@nextui-org/ripple` package. Firstly, the z-index property of the Ripple component has been adjusted from `10` to `0`. This change is crucial as it affects the stacking order of the ripple effect, which is a visual feedback provided when a user interacts with UI elements. The modification aims to resolve an issue where the ripple effect might have been improperly layered on iOS devices, affecting the user's ability to trigger press events correctly.

Secondly, there has been a refinement in the calculation of the x and y coordinates within the `useRipple` function. The coordinates for the ripple effect are now derived from `rect.left` and `rect.top` instead of `rect.x` and `rect.y`. This adjustment ensures that the ripple effect originates correctly relative to the component it is applied to, enhancing the accuracy and visual alignment of the effect during user interactions.

These changes collectively enhance the functionality and visual correctness of the ripple effect in the NextUI framework, ensuring better compatibility and user experience across different devices, especially on iOS.

### Chat

There are 3 ways to chat with [CodeRabbit](https://coderabbit.ai):

- Review comments: Directly reply to a review comment made by CodeRabbit. Example:
	- `I pushed a fix in commit <commit_id>.`
	- `Generate unit testing code for this file.`
	- `Open a follow-up GitHub issue for this discussion.`
- Files and specific lines of code (under the "Files changed" tab): Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new review comment at the desired location with your query. Examples:
	- `@coderabbitai generate unit testing code for this file.`
	-	`@coderabbitai modularize this function.`
- PR comments: Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new PR comment to ask questions about the PR branch. For the best results, please provide a very specific query, as very limited context is provided in this mode. Examples:
	- `@coderabbitai generate interesting stats about this repository and render them as a table.`
	- `@coderabbitai show all the console.log statements in this repository.`
	- `@coderabbitai read src/utils.ts and generate unit testing code.`
	- `@coderabbitai read the files in the src/scheduler package and generate a class diagram using mermaid and a README in the markdown format.`

Note: Be mindful of the bot's finite context window. It's strongly recommended to break down tasks such as reading entire modules into smaller chunks. For a focused discussion, use review comments to chat about specific files and their changes, instead of using the PR comments.

### CodeRabbit Commands (invoked as PR comments)

- `@coderabbitai pause` to pause the reviews on a PR.
- `@coderabbitai resume` to resume the paused reviews.
- `@coderabbitai review` to trigger a review. This is useful when automatic reviews are disabled for the repository.
- `@coderabbitai resolve` resolve all the CodeRabbit review comments.
- `@coderabbitai help` to get help.


Additionally, you can add `@coderabbitai ignore` anywhere in the PR description to prevent this PR from being reviewed.

### CodeRabbit Configration File (`.coderabbit.yaml`)

- You can programmatically configure CodeRabbit by adding a `.coderabbit.yaml` file to the root of your repository.
