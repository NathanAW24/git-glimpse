## Walkthrough
The recent update modifies how the `selectedValue` is computed in dropdown components. Previously, all selected items were combined into a single string with commas. Now, the logic has been refined to only consider the first item in the selection array, simplifying the output and potentially enhancing user experience by preventing confusion over multiple selections.

apps/docs/content/components/dropdown/single-selection.ts, packages/components/dropdown/stories/dropdown.stories.tsx: 

The logic for deriving the `selectedValue` in the `App` component and `SingleSelectionTemplate` function has been updated to take the first element from the `selected` array instead of joining all elements with commas after replacing underscores with spaces.

### PR Objectives

The pull request (PR) number 1708 titled "fix(docs): simplify single dropdown code example" aims to address complexities in the existing code example for a single dropdown component in the documentation. The PR includes a visual representation of the issue, which is linked in the description but not displayed directly. The primary goal is to make the code for the single dropdown clearer and more straightforward for users. This simplification involves modifying how the `selectedValue` is derived in the code examples provided in the documentation and story files.

### AI-Generated Summary of Changes

The changes in this PR simplify the handling of `selectedValue` in both the `App` component and the `SingleSelectionTemplate` function. Previously, the `selectedValue` was derived by joining all elements of the `selected` array with commas and replacing underscores with spaces. The updated logic now directly takes the first element from the `selected` array, streamlining the process and reducing complexity in the code examples.

### Chat

There are 3 ways to chat with [CodeRabbit](https://coderabbit.ai):

- Review comments: Directly reply to a review comment made by CodeRabbit. Example:
	- `I pushed a fix in commit <commit_id>.`
	- `Generate unit testing code for this file.`
	- `Open a follow-up GitHub issue for this discussion.`
- Files and specific lines of code (under the "Files changed" tab): Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new review comment at the desired location with your query. Examples:
	- `@coderabbitai generate unit testing code for this file.`
	-	`@coderabbitai modularize this function.`
- PR comments: Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new PR comment to ask questions about the PR branch. For the best results, please provide a very specific query, as very limited context is provided in this mode. Examples:
	- `@coderabbitai generate interesting stats about this repository and render them as a table.`
	- `@coderabbitai show all the console.log statements in this repository.`
	- `@coderabbitai read src/utils.ts and generate unit testing code.`
	- `@coderabbitai read the files in the src/scheduler package and generate a class diagram using mermaid and a README in the markdown format.`

Note: Be mindful of the bot's finite context window. It's strongly recommended to break down tasks such as reading entire modules into smaller chunks. For a focused discussion, use review comments to chat about specific files and their changes, instead of using the PR comments.

### CodeRabbit Commands (invoked as PR comments)

- `@coderabbitai pause` to pause the reviews on a PR.
- `@coderabbitai resume` to resume the paused reviews.
- `@coderabbitai review` to trigger a review. This is useful when automatic reviews are disabled for the repository.
- `@coderabbitai resolve` resolve all the CodeRabbit review comments.
- `@coderabbitai help` to get help.


Additionally, you can add `@coderabbitai ignore` anywhere in the PR description to prevent this PR from being reviewed.
