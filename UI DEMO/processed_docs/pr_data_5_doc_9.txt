## Walkthrough
The changes in this pull request involve modifications to the motion properties of the accordion component, specifically in the `custom-motion.ts` file. The updates introduce new overflow behavior settings for the accordion, adjusting the `overflowY` property based on the open and closed states of the component.

## AI-generated summary of changes

The diff introduces modifications to the motion properties of an accordion component in the `custom-motion.ts` file. Specifically, two properties related to the overflow behavior of the accordion are added. In the first state, when the accordion is open, the `overflowY` property is set to `"unset"`, allowing for flexible overflow behavior. In the second state, when the accordion is closed, the `overflowY` property is set to `"hidden"`, preventing any overflow from being displayed. These changes affect the visual behavior of the accordion during its open and close transitions.

## PR Summary

The pull request titled "docs(accordion): add overflow to custom motion example" was submitted by the user alexnguyennz and is identified as PR number 3793. The main objective of this PR is to enhance the custom motion example for the accordion component by adding overflow values that align with the default enter and exit animations.

In the current implementation, the content of the accordion item is visible during the exit animation, which can detract from the visual experience. This PR addresses that issue by ensuring that the overflow of the accordion item content is not visible during the exit animation, resulting in a cleaner and more polished appearance.

The author confirms that this change does not introduce any breaking changes to the existing functionality of the accordion component. The proposed updates aim to improve the overall user experience without affecting the current behavior of the component. 

For further details, the pull request can be accessed at the following URL: [PR #3793](https://github.com/nextui-org/nextui/pull/3793).

`15-15`: **LGTM!**

Setting `overflowY` to `"unset"` for the `enter` variant allows for flexible overflow behavior when the accordion is open, which aligns with the PR objective of improving the visual experience.

`33-33`: **LGTM!**

Setting `overflowY` to `"hidden"` for the `exit` variant prevents any overflow from being displayed when the accordion is closed, which aligns with the PR objective of ensuring a cleaner appearance during the exit animation.

### Chat

There are 3 ways to chat with [CodeRabbit](https://coderabbit.ai):

- Review comments: Directly reply to a review comment made by CodeRabbit. Example:
-- `I pushed a fix in commit <commit_id>, please review it.`
-- `Generate unit testing code for this file.`
	- `Open a follow-up GitHub issue for this discussion.`
- Files and specific lines of code (under the "Files changed" tab): Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new review comment at the desired location with your query. Examples:
-- `@coderabbitai generate unit testing code for this file.`
--	`@coderabbitai modularize this function.`
- PR comments: Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new PR comment to ask questions about the PR branch. For the best results, please provide a very specific query, as very limited context is provided in this mode. Examples:
-- `@coderabbitai gather interesting stats about this repository and render them as a table. Additionally, render a pie chart showing the language distribution in the codebase.`
-- `@coderabbitai read src/utils.ts and generate unit testing code.`
-- `@coderabbitai read the files in the src/scheduler package and generate a class diagram using mermaid and a README in the markdown format.`
-- `@coderabbitai help me debug CodeRabbit configuration file.`

Note: Be mindful of the bot's finite context window. It's strongly recommended to break down tasks such as reading entire modules into smaller chunks. For a focused discussion, use review comments to chat about specific files and their changes, instead of using the PR comments.

### CodeRabbit Commands (Invoked using PR comments)

- `@coderabbitai pause` to pause the reviews on a PR.
- `@coderabbitai resume` to resume the paused reviews.
- `@coderabbitai review` to trigger an incremental review. This is useful when automatic reviews are disabled for the repository.
- `@coderabbitai full review` to do a full review from scratch and review all the files again.
- `@coderabbitai summary` to regenerate the summary of the PR.
- `@coderabbitai resolve` resolve all the CodeRabbit review comments.
- `@coderabbitai configuration` to show the current CodeRabbit configuration for the repository.
- `@coderabbitai help` to get help.

### Other keywords and placeholders

- Add `@coderabbitai ignore` anywhere in the PR description to prevent this PR from being reviewed.
- Add `@coderabbitai summary` to generate the high-level summary at a specific location in the PR description.
