packages/components/navbar/src/navbar-menu-transitions.ts: ## Short Summary
The change in functionality involves adjusting the height calculation in the `menuVariants` object in `navbar-menu-transitions.ts` to remove a subtraction of `1px`.

## Alterations to the declarations of exported or public entities
- `menuVariants` object in `navbar-menu-transitions.ts`
  - `height: "calc(100vh - var(--navbar-height) - 1px)"` ‚Üí `height: "calc(100vh - var(--navbar-height))"`

packages/core/theme/src/components/navbar.ts: ## Short summary

The changes in the `navbar.ts` file include adjusting the height calculation for the navbar component to better fit the viewport and fixing a typo in the height calculation for the menu when animation is disabled.

## Alterations to the declarations of exported or public entities

- `const navbar` in `packages/core/theme/src/components/navbar.ts`:
  - Added `"h-[calc(100vh-_var(--navbar-height))]` to adjust the height calculation for the navbar.
  - Modified `"h-[calc(100dvh-_var(--navbar-height)-_1px)]"` to `"h-[calc(100dvh-_var(--navbar-height))]` for the menu height calculation when animation is disabled.

### AI-generated summary of generated summaries

The recent changes in the `navbar-menu-transitions.ts` and `navbar.ts` files focus on refining the height calculations for the navbar and its menu components. Specifically, in `navbar-menu-transitions.ts`, the height calculation in the `menuVariants` object was simplified by removing an unnecessary subtraction of `1px`. Similarly, in `navbar.ts`, the height calculation for the navbar was adjusted to better fit the viewport, and a typo in the height calculation for the menu when animation is disabled was corrected. These modifications ensure more accurate and consistent height measurements across different viewport configurations.

### Alterations to the declarations of exported or public entities

#### `packages/components/navbar/src/navbar-menu-transitions.ts`

- **Before:**
  ```typescript
  const menuVariants = {
    height: "calc(100vh - var(--navbar-height) - 1px)"
  };
  ```

- **After:**
  ```typescript
  const menuVariants = {
    height: "calc(100vh - var(--navbar-height))"
  };
  ```

#### `packages/core/theme/src/components/navbar.ts`

- **Before:**
  ```typescript
  const navbar = {
    // Other properties
    height: "h-[calc(100dvh-_var(--navbar-height)-_1px)]"
  };
  ```

- **After:**
  ```typescript
  const navbar = {
    // Other properties
    height: "h-[calc(100dvh-_var(--navbar-height))]",
    "h-[calc(100vh-_var(--navbar-height))]"
  };

<summary>Tips</summary>

### Chat

There are 3 ways to chat with [CodeRabbit](https://coderabbit.ai):

- Review comments: Directly reply to a review comment made by CodeRabbit. Example:
	- `I pushed a fix in commit <commit_id>.`
	- `Generate unit testing code for this file.`
	- `Open a follow-up GitHub issue for this discussion.`
- Files and specific lines of code (under the "Files changed" tab): Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new review comment at the desired location with your query. Examples:
	- `@coderabbitai generate unit testing code for this file.`
	-	`@coderabbitai modularize this function.`
- PR comments: Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new PR comment to ask questions about the PR branch. For the best results, please provide a very specific query, as very limited context is provided in this mode. Examples:
	- `@coderabbitai generate interesting stats about this repository and render them as a table.`
	- `@coderabbitai show all the console.log statements in this repository.`
	- `@coderabbitai read src/utils.ts and generate unit testing code.`
	- `@coderabbitai read the files in the src/scheduler package and generate a class diagram using mermaid and a README in the markdown format.`

Note: Be mindful of the bot's finite context window. It's strongly recommended to break down tasks such as reading entire modules into smaller chunks. For a focused discussion, use review comments to chat about specific files and their changes, instead of using the PR comments.

### CodeRabbit Commands (invoked as PR comments)

- `@coderabbitai pause` to pause the reviews on a PR.
- `@coderabbitai resume` to resume the paused reviews.
- `@coderabbitai review` to trigger a review. This is useful when automatic reviews are disabled for the repository.
- `@coderabbitai resolve` resolve all the CodeRabbit review comments.
- `@coderabbitai help` to get help.


Additionally, you can add `@coderabbitai ignore` anywhere in the PR description to prevent this PR from being reviewed.

### CodeRabbit Configration File (`.coderabbit.yaml`)

- You can programmatically configure CodeRabbit by adding a `.coderabbit.yaml` file to the root of your repository.
- Please see the [configuration documentation](https://docs.coderabbit.ai/guides/configure-coderabbit) for more information.
- If your editor has YAML language server enabled, you can add the path at the top of this file to enable auto-completion and validation: `# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://coderabbit.ai/integrations/schema.v2.json`
