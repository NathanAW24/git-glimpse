Description:
Remove the default duplicate Transition utilities in TailwindCSS (they do not need to be redefined) to prevent users from customizing transition effects, such as duration-300 being overridden by the higher priority of the NextUI Plugin and not working.
Removing these redundant transition effects will not cause existing component effects to fail because TailwindCSS already includes them. Please feel free to check the preview documentation page. We only need to set DEFAULT_TRANSITION_DURATION to the DEFAULT key in order to modify the default transition time.
See: https://tailwindcss.com/docs/transition-property

## Walkthrough
The update addresses a conflict between the `@nextui-org/theme` package and Tailwind CSS by adjusting transition utilities. By deactivating specific transition definitions in NextUI, it prevents them from conflicting with Tailwind's default transitions, ensuring a smoother integration experience for developers utilizing both frameworks.

### PR Objectives (User Provided Facts)

This pull request, numbered 2677 and titled "fix: remove conflicting transition utilities," aims to address the conflict between TailwindCSS and the NextUI Plugin regarding default transition properties. By removing redundant transition utilities in TailwindCSS, the PR seeks to prevent the NextUI Plugin from overriding these properties, enabling users to customize transition effects without interference.

The linked issue, #1502, highlights how the NextUI Plugin supersedes TailwindCSS's default transition properties, causing issues in setting custom transitions. The PR intends to rectify this by adjusting the `DEFAULT_TRANSITION_DURATION` to the `DEFAULT` key, ensuring existing component effects remain unaffected by these changes. The goal is to eliminate duplicate transitions and provide a seamless transition customization experience for users.

### AI-Generated Summary of Generated Summaries

In response to the conflict between TailwindCSS and the NextUI Plugin regarding transition utilities, this pull request introduces changes across multiple files to resolve the issue effectively. A new changeset file (`rare-ants-ring.md`) has been created to document the patch applied to the `@nextui-org/theme` package, specifically targeting the removal of conflicting transition utilities as outlined in issue #1502.

Within the `plugin.ts` file located in the `packages/core/theme/src` directory, the PR incorporates the `DEFAULT_TRANSITION_DURATION` constant from `./utilities/transition` into the `transitionDuration` object under the key `DEFAULT`. This adjustment aims to streamline transition durations and mitigate conflicts between the two frameworks.

Additionally, modifications in the `transition.ts` file within the same directory involve commenting out or temporarily removing various transition definitions affecting CSS classes like `.transition`, `.transition-colors`, `.transition-opacity`, `.transition-shadow`, and `.transition-transform. These actions are taken to deactivate redundant or conflicting transition utilities causing issues, as reported in the linked bug.

Overall, these changes focus on resolving the priority conflict between TailwindCSS and NextUI's transition utilities, ensuring a smoother transition customization experience for users while maintaining the integrity of existing component effects.

### Chat

There are 3 ways to chat with [CodeRabbit](https://coderabbit.ai):

- Review comments: Directly reply to a review comment made by CodeRabbit. Example:
	- `I pushed a fix in commit <commit_id>.`
	- `Generate unit testing code for this file.`
	- `Open a follow-up GitHub issue for this discussion.`
- Files and specific lines of code (under the "Files changed" tab): Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new review comment at the desired location with your query. Examples:
	- `@coderabbitai generate unit testing code for this file.`
	-	`@coderabbitai modularize this function.`
- PR comments: Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new PR comment to ask questions about the PR branch. For the best results, please provide a very specific query, as very limited context is provided in this mode. Examples:
	- `@coderabbitai generate interesting stats about this repository and render them as a table.`
	- `@coderabbitai show all the console.log statements in this repository.`
	- `@coderabbitai read src/utils.ts and generate unit testing code.`
	- `@coderabbitai read the files in the src/scheduler package and generate a class diagram using mermaid and a README in the markdown format.`

Note: Be mindful of the bot's finite context window. It's strongly recommended to break down tasks such as reading entire modules into smaller chunks. For a focused discussion, use review comments to chat about specific files and their changes, instead of using the PR comments.

### CodeRabbit Commands (invoked as PR comments)

- `@coderabbitai pause` to pause the reviews on a PR.
- `@coderabbitai resume` to resume the paused reviews.
- `@coderabbitai review` to trigger a review. This is useful when automatic reviews are disabled for the repository.
- `@coderabbitai resolve` resolve all the CodeRabbit review comments.
- `@coderabbitai help` to get help.


Additionally, you can add `@coderabbitai ignore` anywhere in the PR description to prevent this PR from being reviewed.

### CodeRabbit Configration File (`.coderabbit.yaml`)

- You can programmatically configure CodeRabbit by adding a `.coderabbit.yaml` file to the root of your repository.
- Please see the [configuration documentation](https://docs.coderabbit.ai/guides/configure-coderabbit) for more information.
- If your editor has YAML language server enabled, you can add the path at the top of this file to enable auto-completion and validation: `# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://coderabbit.ai/integrations/schema.v2.json`
