Description:
Closes #3745
üìù Description

Fixes the full width functionality.

‚õ≥Ô∏è Current behavior (updates)
Even when the full-width is set to false, the component takes the full-width of the parent. This should not be the case.
Examples for the bug are:

Input:


  
    
    

    Screen.Recording.2024-09-16.at.7.20.38.PM.mov
    
  

  

  



Select:


  
    
    

    Screen.Recording.2024-09-16.at.7.19.18.PM.mov
    
  

  

  


üöÄ New behavior
The PR fixes the full-width functionality:

Input


  
    
    

    Screen.Recording.2024-09-16.at.7.21.23.PM.mov
    
  

  

  



Select:


  
    
    

    Screen.Recording.2024-09-16.at.7.22.51.PM.mov
    
  

  

  


In select the min-w-40 is added so that the select component has atleast width of 10rem.
üí£ Is this a breaking change (Yes/No): No

## PR Summary

The pull request titled "fix(input): fixing the fullWidth functionality in input and select" by user macci001 addresses an issue related to the `fullWidth` functionality in both Input and Select components of the NextUI library. This PR closes issue #3745. The current behavior was that even when the `fullWidth` property was set to `false`, the components still occupied the full width of their parent containers, which was not the intended functionality. The PR provides examples of the bug for both Input and Select components, demonstrating the issue visually.

The new behavior introduced by this PR ensures that the `fullWidth` functionality works as expected. Specifically, when `fullWidth` is set to `false`, the Input and Select components will no longer take the full width of their parent. Additionally, for the Select component, a minimum width of 10rem is enforced by adding a `min-w-40` class. The PR confirms that this change is not a breaking change.

## Objectives from Linked Issues

The linked issue #3745 describes a bug where the `fullWidth` prop of the Select component does not function as intended. According to the documentation, the `fullWidth` prop should determine whether the Select component occupies the full width of its parent, with a default value of `true`. However, users reported that setting `fullWidth={false}` had no effect, as the Select component continued to take the full width of its parent container.

To reproduce the issue, users were instructed to place a Select component inside a wrapper with a fixed width and set the `fullWidth` prop to `false`. The expected behavior was that this would remove the `w-full` class from the component, allowing it to respect the specified width. The issue was confirmed to occur on Windows using the Chrome browser, and a CodeSandbox link was provided for demonstration.

### Chat

There are 3 ways to chat with [CodeRabbit](https://coderabbit.ai):

- Review comments: Directly reply to a review comment made by CodeRabbit. Example:
  - `I pushed a fix in commit <commit_id>, please review it.`
  - `Generate unit testing code for this file.`
  - `Open a follow-up GitHub issue for this discussion.`
- Files and specific lines of code (under the "Files changed" tab): Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new review comment at the desired location with your query. Examples:
  - `@coderabbitai generate unit testing code for this file.`
  -	`@coderabbitai modularize this function.`
- PR comments: Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new PR comment to ask questions about the PR branch. For the best results, please provide a very specific query, as very limited context is provided in this mode. Examples:
  - `@coderabbitai gather interesting stats about this repository and render them as a table. Additionally, render a pie chart showing the language distribution in the codebase.`
  - `@coderabbitai read src/utils.ts and generate unit testing code.`
  - `@coderabbitai read the files in the src/scheduler package and generate a class diagram using mermaid and a README in the markdown format.`
  - `@coderabbitai help me debug CodeRabbit configuration file.`

Note: Be mindful of the bot's finite context window. It's strongly recommended to break down tasks such as reading entire modules into smaller chunks. For a focused discussion, use review comments to chat about specific files and their changes, instead of using the PR comments.
