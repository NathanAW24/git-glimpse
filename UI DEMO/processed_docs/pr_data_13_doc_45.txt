## Walkthrough

The update to the `Cmdk` component addresses a bug where searching with a single character in the modal would show no results. By adding `query` to the `useEffect` dependency array and adjusting the conditional rendering, the component now properly displays a message when no results are found for a search query, even if it's just one character. This change improves user feedback and aligns with expected behavior for search functionalities.

## Changes

| File | Change Summary |
|------|----------------|
| `apps/docs/components/cmdk.tsx` | Added `query` to `useEffect` dependency array; adjusted conditional rendering in `Command.List` to display content based on `query` length. |

### PR Objectives

This pull request (PR #2644) addresses a specific bug within the NextUI library, specifically within its search modal functionality. The issue, documented as #2643, arises when users attempt to search using a single character. In such cases, the search modal fails to return any results, which is not the intended behavior. The PR aims to rectify this by ensuring that even single-character searches yield appropriate feedback or results.

The description of the PR provides a clear overview of the problem and the proposed solution. It highlights that the current behavior of the search modal does not meet user expectations when searching with only one character. The expected behavior, as outlined, should provide users with a message indicating that no results were found and suggest trying a more detailed search query. This change is aimed at enhancing user experience by providing more informative feedback during the search process.

Additionally, the PR includes a link to a visual representation of the new behavior, although the link is formatted as a text placeholder rather than an actual URL. This suggests that the PR intends to offer a visual confirmation of the changes made, which is a common practice to help reviewers understand the impact of the proposed modifications visually.

The linked issue (#2643) provides further context, detailing the bug's manifestation and the expected behavior post-fix. It includes a screenshot illustrating the bug, thereby offering a visual reference to the problem at hand. The issue explicitly mentions the need to remove recent search results when conducting a single-character search, which is a critical detail for understanding the scope of the bug and the intended solution.

The code changes are confined to the `apps/docs/components/cmdk.tsx` file, where adjustments have been made to the `useEffect` dependency array to include `query`. This change likely aims to ensure that the component reacts appropriately to changes in the search query. Additionally, conditional rendering logic within the `Command.List` component has been modified to better handle cases where the search query is a single character.

### AI-generated Summary of Generated Summaries

The pull request introduces a fix to the NextUI library's search modal, specifically addressing an issue where searches with a single character would fail to return any results. The solution involves modifications to the `apps/docs/components/cmdk.tsx` file, where the `useEffect` dependency array has been updated to include `query`. This change ensures that the component's behavior is responsive to changes in the search query. Furthermore, the conditional rendering within the `Command.List` component has been adjusted to provide appropriate feedback for single-character searches. This adjustment aims to enhance user experience by ensuring that users are informed when no results are found for their search query and are encouraged to try a more detailed search. The PR and the linked issue together highlight the importance of providing clear and helpful feedback to users during the search process, especially in cases where the search criteria might be too broad or too narrow to yield useful results.

### Chat

There are 3 ways to chat with [CodeRabbit](https://coderabbit.ai):

- Review comments: Directly reply to a review comment made by CodeRabbit. Example:
	- `I pushed a fix in commit <commit_id>.`
	- `Generate unit testing code for this file.`
	- `Open a follow-up GitHub issue for this discussion.`
- Files and specific lines of code (under the "Files changed" tab): Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new review comment at the desired location with your query. Examples:
	- `@coderabbitai generate unit testing code for this file.`
	-	`@coderabbitai modularize this function.`
- PR comments: Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new PR comment to ask questions about the PR branch. For the best results, please provide a very specific query, as very limited context is provided in this mode. Examples:
	- `@coderabbitai generate interesting stats about this repository and render them as a table.`
	- `@coderabbitai show all the console.log statements in this repository.`
	- `@coderabbitai read src/utils.ts and generate unit testing code.`
	- `@coderabbitai read the files in the src/scheduler package and generate a class diagram using mermaid and a README in the markdown format.`

Note: Be mindful of the bot's finite context window. It's strongly recommended to break down tasks such as reading entire modules into smaller chunks. For a focused discussion, use review comments to chat about specific files and their changes, instead of using the PR comments.

### CodeRabbit Commands (invoked as PR comments)

- `@coderabbitai resume` to resume the paused reviews.
- `@coderabbitai review` to trigger a review. This is useful when automatic reviews are disabled for the repository.
- `@coderabbitai resolve` resolve all the CodeRabbit review comments.
- `@coderabbitai help` to get help.


Additionally, you can add `@coderabbitai ignore` anywhere in the PR description to prevent this PR from being reviewed.
