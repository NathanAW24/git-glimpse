## AI-generated summary of changes

The document titled "Dark mode" has been updated to provide clearer instructions and examples for implementing dark mode in applications using NextUI and Next.js. The changes include the addition of a section on using the `next-themes` library, which enhances theme switching capabilities. The setup instructions for both the Next.js App Directory and Pages Directory have been detailed, including the installation of `next-themes` and wrapping the application with the `NextThemesProvider`. 

The theme switcher component has been introduced in both setups, demonstrating how to toggle between light and dark modes using buttons. Additionally, a new section has been added for using the `use-dark-mode` hook in plain React applications, with installation instructions and examples for integrating the hook into the main application component and the theme switcher. 

Minor corrections were made to the text, such as fixing a typo in the note regarding theme names in the `tailwind.config.js` file. Overall, the document now provides a more comprehensive guide for implementing dark mode across different frameworks and setups.

### Chat

There are 3 ways to chat with [CodeRabbit](https://coderabbit.ai):

- Review comments: Directly reply to a review comment made by CodeRabbit. Example:
  - `I pushed a fix in commit <commit_id>, please review it.`
  - `Generate unit testing code for this file.`
  - `Open a follow-up GitHub issue for this discussion.`
- Files and specific lines of code (under the "Files changed" tab): Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new review comment at the desired location with your query. Examples:
  - `@coderabbitai generate unit testing code for this file.`
  -	`@coderabbitai modularize this function.`
- PR comments: Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new PR comment to ask questions about the PR branch. For the best results, please provide a very specific query, as very limited context is provided in this mode. Examples:
  - `@coderabbitai gather interesting stats about this repository and render them as a table. Additionally, render a pie chart showing the language distribution in the codebase.`
  - `@coderabbitai read src/utils.ts and generate unit testing code.`
  - `@coderabbitai read the files in the src/scheduler package and generate a class diagram using mermaid and a README in the markdown format.`
  - `@coderabbitai help me debug CodeRabbit configuration file.`

Note: Be mindful of the bot's finite context window. It's strongly recommended to break down tasks such as reading entire modules into smaller chunks. For a focused discussion, use review comments to chat about specific files and their changes, instead of using the PR comments.
