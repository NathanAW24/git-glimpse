Description:
Description
This PR addresses a consistency issue found across multiple files where the status field values are inconsistently capitalized. This inconsistency affects the UI representation, as the status color does not display correctly unless the value is in lowercase. All instances of the status field values have been normalized to lowercase to ensure consistent behavior and visual representation in the UI.
Changes

Standardized the status field values to lowercase in approximately 13 files to match the expected case-sensitive values required for proper UI rendering.

Impact

Ensuring the status field values are consistently lowercase will fix the color-coding of statuses in the UI, enhancing the visual consistency and user experience.

### PR Objectives

The primary objective of Pull Request (PR) #2947 is to address a consistency issue with the `status` field values across multiple files in a codebase. The PR aims to normalize these values to lowercase to ensure uniform behavior and visual representation in the user interface (UI). This normalization is crucial because the UI's status color-coding functionality is case-sensitive and does not display correctly unless the `status` values are in lowercase. The changes span approximately 13 files, standardizing the `status` field values to lowercase to match the expected case-sensitive values required for proper UI rendering. This fix is expected to enhance visual consistency and improve the user experience by ensuring that the color-coding of statuses in the UI is accurate and consistent.

### AI-Generated Summary of Generated Summaries

This PR involves a systematic update across multiple files to standardize the `status` field values to "active" by converting them from "Active" to lowercase. The changes affect various components and utilities within the project, specifically targeting files that handle user data arrays where the `status` field is present. The modifications are made in several TypeScript files under the `apps/docs/app/examples` and `apps/docs/content/components` directories, as well as in a utility file located at `packages/utilities/stories-utils/src/mocks/data.ts`.

The primary alteration across these files is the consistent transformation of the `status` value from "Active" to "active". This change is applied to user data arrays in different contexts, including autocomplete components, list boxes, select components, and tables. Each file typically contains a data array named `users` or `usersData`, where each user object includes a `status` field. The PR updates this field in all instances to ensure that the UI renders the status color correctly, adhering to the case-sensitive requirements of the UI's styling logic.

<details>
<summary>Verification successful</summary>



---

The verification process focused on ensuring that the `status` field in the `usersData` array within the file `packages/utilities/stories-utils/src/mocks/data.ts` is consistently set to "active" as intended. The script executed searched for occurrences of `status: "active"` within this specific file.

### Verification Results:
- The script output confirms that the `status` field is set to "active" for multiple entries within the `usersData` array. There are 13 occurrences of `status: "active"`.

### Conclusion:
Based on the script output, it appears that the `status` field is consistently set to "active" across all user entries in the `usersData` array as intended. There are no indications of other values such as "paused" or "vacation" which were part of the expected possible values. This consistency aligns with the intended changes mentioned in the review comment.

There are 3 ways to chat with [CodeRabbit](https://coderabbit.ai):

- Review comments: Directly reply to a review comment made by CodeRabbit. Example:
	- `I pushed a fix in commit <commit_id>.`
	- `Generate unit testing code for this file.`
	- `Open a follow-up GitHub issue for this discussion.`
- Files and specific lines of code (under the "Files changed" tab): Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new review comment at the desired location with your query. Examples:
	- `@coderabbitai generate unit testing code for this file.`
	-	`@coderabbitai modularize this function.`
- PR comments: Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new PR comment to ask questions about the PR branch. For the best results, please provide a very specific query, as very limited context is provided in this mode. Examples:
	- `@coderabbitai generate interesting stats about this repository and render them as a table.`
	- `@coderabbitai show all the console.log statements in this repository.`
	- `@coderabbitai read src/utils.ts and generate unit testing code.`
	- `@coderabbitai read the files in the src/scheduler package and generate a class diagram using mermaid and a README in the markdown format.`

Note: Be mindful of the bot's finite context window. It's strongly recommended to break down tasks such as reading entire modules into smaller chunks. For a focused discussion, use review comments to chat about specific files and their changes, instead of using the PR comments.

### CodeRabbit Commands (invoked as PR comments)

- `@coderabbitai pause` to pause the reviews on a PR.
- `@coderabbitai resume` to resume the paused reviews.
- `@coderabbitai review` to trigger a review. This is useful when automatic reviews are disabled for the repository.
- `@coderabbitai resolve` resolve all the CodeRabbit review comments.
- `@coderabbitai help` to get help.


Additionally, you can add `@coderabbitai ignore` anywhere in the PR description to prevent this PR from being reviewed.
