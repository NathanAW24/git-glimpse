Closes #3641
Closes #3642
üìù Description
‚õ≥Ô∏è Current behavior (updates)
As described in #3641,  currently, if the html has dir attribute equal to rtl, the arrow keys look incorrect.
üöÄ New behavior
Added  order to prevButton, nextButton and header . Added rtl:flex-row-reverse to headerWrapper.
The prev button should always be a left arrow and the next button should always be a right arrow, hence removed condition that changed arrow type based on locale direction.
Calendar with dir="rtl"

Date Picker with dir="rtl"

Date picker in Arabic

üí£ Is this a breaking change (Yes/No):
No.

## Walkthrough

This update enhances the `@nextui-org/calendar` package by addressing keyboard navigation for right-to-left (RTL) layouts and simplifying the rendering of navigation icons. It ensures that arrow keys function intuitively in RTL contexts, improving accessibility. Additionally, the internal logic has been streamlined by removing unnecessary hooks, and the visual arrangement of calendar navigation buttons has been adjusted for better compatibility with RTL layouts.

# Existing changesets

```
.changeset/slow-forks-nail.md: ## AI-generated summary of changes

This update introduces a patch for the `@nextui-org/calendar` package, specifically addressing an issue with the keyboard navigation order when the HTML direction is set to "rtl" (right-to-left). The change ensures that the arrow keys function correctly in this context, enhancing accessibility and usability for users who rely on keyboard navigation in RTL layouts. The fix modifies the internal logic governing key event handling, ensuring that the navigation flow aligns with user expectations in RTL environments. This improvement is crucial for applications that cater to multilingual users or those using RTL languages, providing a more intuitive interaction model.

Additionally, the changes made to the `CalendarBase` component in `calendar-base.tsx` involve the removal of the `useLocale` hook and its associated logic, simplifying the rendering of navigation icons to a static display. The left button now always shows the `ChevronLeftIcon`, and the right button always shows the `ChevronRightIcon`, regardless of text direction. This change streamlines the component's logic and reduces complexity in rendering.

Modifications to the styling and layout of a calendar component in `packages/core/theme/src/components/calendar.ts` include the addition of specific ordering classes to the `prevButton`, `nextButton`, and `header` elements, altering their visual arrangement. The `prevButton` is assigned an "order-1" class, the `header` receives an "order-2" class, and the `nextButton` gets an "order-3" class. The `headerWrapper` class has been modified to accommodate right-to-left layouts by adding the `rtl:flex-row-reverse` class, enhancing responsiveness to different text directions.

## PR Summary

The pull request titled "fix(calendar): arrows changing order when html has dir='rtl'" addresses a bug related to the display of arrow keys in the Calendar and Date Picker components when the HTML direction is set to right-to-left (RTL). The issue was identified in linked issues #3641 and #3642, where it was noted that the arrow keys appeared incorrect under RTL conditions. The changes made in this PR include adding CSS `order` properties to the previous and next buttons, as well as the header, to ensure that the previous button consistently displays as a left arrow and the next button as a right arrow. Additionally, the `rtl:flex-row-reverse` class was applied to the header wrapper to maintain the correct layout. The PR includes visual examples demonstrating the corrected appearance of the Calendar and Date Picker components when the `dir` attribute is set to RTL. Importantly, this update is not a breaking change.

## Objectives from Linked Issues

The objectives outlined in the linked issues, specifically issue #3641, focus on addressing the lack of RTL support in the Calendar component of the NextUI library. Users reported that when the HTML `dir` attribute is set to RTL, the arrows in both the Calendar and Date Picker do not display correctly, leading to a confusing user experience. The primary goal is to ensure that the arrow keys are visually appropriate for RTL layouts, with the expectation that the previous arrow should always point left and the next arrow should always point right, regardless of the locale direction. The issues also provided steps to reproduce the problem and highlighted the need for a fix to improve accessibility and usability for RTL language users.

### Chat

There are 3 ways to chat with [CodeRabbit](https://coderabbit.ai):

- Review comments: Directly reply to a review comment made by CodeRabbit. Example:
	- `I pushed a fix in commit <commit_id>.`
	- `Generate unit testing code for this file.`
	- `Open a follow-up GitHub issue for this discussion.`
- Files and specific lines of code (under the "Files changed" tab): Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new review comment at the desired location with your query. Examples:
	- `@coderabbitai generate unit testing code for this file.`
	-	`@coderabbitai modularize this function.`
- PR comments: Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new PR comment to ask questions about the PR branch. For the best results, please provide a very specific query, as very limited context is provided in this mode. Examples:
	- `@coderabbitai generate interesting stats about this repository and render them as a table.`
	- `@coderabbitai show all the console.log statements in this repository.`
	- `@coderabbitai read src/utils.ts and generate unit testing code.`
	- `@coderabbitai read the files in the src/scheduler package and generate a class diagram using mermaid and a README in the markdown format.`
	- `@coderabbitai help me debug CodeRabbit configuration file.`

Note: Be mindful of the bot's finite context window. It's strongly recommended to break down tasks such as reading entire modules into smaller chunks. For a focused discussion, use review comments to chat about specific files and their changes, instead of using the PR comments.
