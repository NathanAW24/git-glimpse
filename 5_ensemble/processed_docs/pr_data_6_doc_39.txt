## Walkthrough

The recent changes involve minor adjustments in two Storybook files related to modal and tabs components. The `modal.stories.tsx` file removed the direct import of React, indicating a move towards newer React practices. In the `tabs.stories.tsx`, the JSX structure was simplified by removing a redundant width class from the `Card` component, ensuring clearer styling without affecting the overall functionality.

packages/components/modal/stories/modal.stories.tsx: ## AI-generated summary of changes

The diff shows a minor modification in the import statements of the `modal.stories.tsx` file. Specifically, the import of React has been removed. This change suggests that the file may no longer rely on React directly, possibly indicating a shift toward using React components in a way that does not require explicit React imports, which is common in newer versions of React (17 and above). The remaining imports from `@storybook/react`, `@nextui-org/theme`, and `@nextui-org/button` remain unchanged, indicating that the core functionality related to Storybook and the NextUI components is still intact.

## Alterations to the declarations of exported or public entities

- No changes to the declarations of exported or public entities were made in `packages/components/modal/stories/modal.stories.tsx`.

packages/components/tabs/stories/tabs.stories.tsx: ## AI-generated summary of changes

The diff reflects a minor change in the JSX structure of the `WithFormTemplate` component within the `tabs.stories.tsx` file. Specifically, the width property of the `Card` component has been simplified by removing the redundant `w-full` class. This alteration streamlines the styling by ensuring that the `Card` component maintains a fixed width of `340px` without the additional specification of `w-full`, which could potentially conflict or cause confusion regarding the intended layout. The overall functionality and rendering logic of the component remain unchanged, as the visual output will still display the `Card` at a width of `340px` and a height of `400px`.

## Alterations to the declarations of exported or public entities

- No changes to the declarations of exported or public entities were made in `packages/components/tabs/stories/tabs.stories.tsx`.

### Chat

There are 3 ways to chat with [CodeRabbit](https://coderabbit.ai):

- Review comments: Directly reply to a review comment made by CodeRabbit. Example:
	- `I pushed a fix in commit <commit_id>.`
	- `Generate unit testing code for this file.`
	- `Open a follow-up GitHub issue for this discussion.`
- Files and specific lines of code (under the "Files changed" tab): Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new review comment at the desired location with your query. Examples:
	- `@coderabbitai generate unit testing code for this file.`
	-	`@coderabbitai modularize this function.`
- PR comments: Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new PR comment to ask questions about the PR branch. For the best results, please provide a very specific query, as very limited context is provided in this mode. Examples:
	- `@coderabbitai generate interesting stats about this repository and render them as a table.`
	- `@coderabbitai show all the console.log statements in this repository.`
	- `@coderabbitai read src/utils.ts and generate unit testing code.`
	- `@coderabbitai read the files in the src/scheduler package and generate a class diagram using mermaid and a README in the markdown format.`
	- `@coderabbitai help me debug CodeRabbit configuration file.`

Note: Be mindful of the bot's finite context window. It's strongly recommended to break down tasks such as reading entire modules into smaller chunks. For a focused discussion, use review comments to chat about specific files and their changes, instead of using the PR comments.

### CodeRabbit Commands (invoked as PR comments)

- `@coderabbitai pause` to pause the reviews on a PR.
- `@coderabbitai resume` to resume the paused reviews.
- `@coderabbitai review` to trigger an incremental review. This is useful when automatic reviews are disabled for the repository.
- `@coderabbitai full review` to do a full review from scratch and review all the files again.
- `@coderabbitai summary` to regenerate the summary of the PR.
- `@coderabbitai resolve` resolve all the CodeRabbit review comments.
- `@coderabbitai configuration` to show the current CodeRabbit configuration for the repository.
- `@coderabbitai help` to get help.


Additionally, you can add `@coderabbitai ignore` anywhere in the PR description to prevent this PR from being reviewed.

### CodeRabbit Configuration File (`.coderabbit.yaml`)

- You can programmatically configure CodeRabbit by adding a `.coderabbit.yaml` file to the root of your repository.
- Please see the [configuration documentation](https://docs.coderabbit.ai/guides/configure-coderabbit) for more information.
- If your editor has YAML language server enabled, you can add the path at the top of this file to enable auto-completion and validation: `# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://coderabbit.ai/integrations/schema.v2.json`
