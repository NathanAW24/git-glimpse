## Walkthrough

The update to the `@nextui-org/theme` package enhances the `skeleton` component by making it invisible after data is loaded. This involves adjusting visibility, opacity, and transition properties, while also adding a new CSS class. These improvements prevent skeletons from overlapping with other elements and fix a skeleton overflow issue, addressing issues #3214 and #3670.

.changeset/twelve-ants-leave.md: ## Summary
The file `twelve-ants-leave.md` introduces a patch to the `@nextui-org/theme` package that makes the skeleton invisible after data is loaded, addressing issues #3214 and #3670, while also fixing a skeleton overflow issue to improve user interface rendering without overflow. The changes also include the removal of the class `"data-[loaded=true]:overflow-visible"` from the `skeleton` component, altering its overflow behavior in the loaded state, and the addition of the class `"data-[loaded=true]:before:-z-10"` to influence the stacking order of pseudo-elements.

### Alterations to the declarations of exported or public entities

- No alterations to the declarations of exported or public entities were made.

---

packages/core/theme/src/components/skeleton.ts: ### Summary

The changes in `skeleton.ts` include adding visibility properties for `before` and `after` elements, adjusting opacity and visibility settings for certain states, modifying transition properties related to opacity and visibility, and removing the class `"data-[loaded=true]:overflow-visible"`. Additionally, a new CSS class (`-z-10`) is added to the `before` pseudo-element in a specific context within the `skeleton` component.

### Alterations to the declarations of exported or public entities

- `const skeleton` in `packages/core/theme/src/components/skeleton.ts`:
  - Added `"before:visible"` and `"after:visible"` properties.
  - Modified opacity and visibility settings for certain states.
  - Adjusted transition properties related to opacity and visibility.

---

packages/core/theme/src/utilities/transition.ts: ### Summary

In the `transition.ts` file located in `packages/core/theme/src/utilities`, the changes involve correcting the `transition-property` declarations by removing extra spaces before the property names and adding a new CSS class `.transition-opacity-visibility` with specific transition properties. The modifications enhance the consistency of the property declarations by ensuring that there are no unintended spaces, which could potentially lead to issues in CSS parsing or application.

## PR Summary

**Title:** fix(theme): make skeleton invisible after data loaded

**User:** chirokas

**Number:** 3217

**Description:**  
This pull request aims to resolve the issue of the skeleton component remaining visible after data has been loaded. The change is intended to enhance user interaction by ensuring that the skeleton does not overlap with other UI elements, which can hinder usability.

## Objectives from Linked Issues

**Issue #3214:** [BUG] - Skeleton animation is superimposed on other elements

- **NextUI Version:** 2.4.1
- **Bug Description:** The skeleton animation is overlapping with other elements, causing interaction issues. In a specific case with two skeleton components containing buttons, the first button is only partially clickable (25%) due to the overlap from the second skeleton.
- **Expected Behavior:** The `isLoaded` prop should effectively hide the skeleton to prevent it from obstructing other elements.
- **Example Website/App:** A sandbox link is provided to illustrate the issue.
- **Steps to Reproduce:**
  1. Place the mouse cursor on the first button.
  2. Place the cursor on the second button.
- **Operating System:** Windows 11
- **Browser:** Chrome

## Comments Summary

1. **jrgarciadev:**  
   - Suggests that the overlapping issue could be resolved by applying a `z-[-1]` style when the skeleton is loaded.

2. **LeakedDave:**  
   - Asks if the fix can be implemented in their own project. They report experiencing an issue where, when `isLoaded` is set to true, strange bars appear behind the Skeleton, particularly when child components are included within the skeleton. This problem is noted to occur specifically in Chrome.

3. **wingkwong:**  
   - Requests that chirokas also investigate an animation flashing issue referenced in another linked issue (#3670), indicating ongoing concerns about the skeleton component's behavior.

4. **chirokas:**  
   - Proposes implementing a smooth fade-in animation (Hide -> Show) for the skeleton component to improve user experience and provides a video link to demonstrate the desired animation effect.

### Chat

There are 3 ways to chat with [CodeRabbit](https://coderabbit.ai):

- Review comments: Directly reply to a review comment made by CodeRabbit. Example:
	- `I pushed a fix in commit <commit_id>.`
	- `Generate unit testing code for this file.`
	- `Open a follow-up GitHub issue for this discussion.`
- Files and specific lines of code (under the "Files changed" tab): Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new review comment at the desired location with your query. Examples:
	- `@coderabbitai generate unit testing code for this file.`
	-	`@coderabbitai modularize this function.`
- PR comments: Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new PR comment to ask questions about the PR branch. For the best results, please provide a very specific query, as very limited context is provided in this mode. Examples:
	- `@coderabbitai generate interesting stats about this repository and render them as a table.`
	- `@coderabbitai show all the console.log statements in this repository.`
	- `@coderabbitai read src/utils.ts and generate unit testing code.`
	- `@coderabbitai read the files in the src/scheduler package and generate a class diagram using mermaid and a README in the markdown format.`
	- `@coderabbitai help me debug CodeRabbit configuration file.`

Note: Be mindful of the bot's finite context window. It's strongly recommended to break down tasks such as reading entire modules into smaller chunks. For a focused discussion, use review comments to chat about specific files and their changes, instead of using the PR comments.

### CodeRabbit Commands (invoked as PR comments)

- `@coderabbitai pause` to pause the reviews on a PR.
- `@coderabbitai resume` to resume the paused reviews.
- `@coderabbitai review` to trigger an incremental review. This is useful when automatic reviews are disabled for the repository.
- `@coderabbitai full review` to do a full review from scratch and review all the files again.
- `@coderabbitai summary` to regenerate the summary of the PR.
- `@coderabbitai resolve` resolve all the CodeRabbit review comments.
- `@coderabbitai configuration` to show the current CodeRabbit configuration for the repository.
- `@coderabbitai help` to get help.


Additionally, you can add `@coderabbitai ignore` anywhere in the PR description to prevent this PR from being reviewed.
