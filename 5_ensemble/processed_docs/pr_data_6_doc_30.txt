## Walkthrough

This update enhances the `@nextui-org/popover` package by introducing a new feature that allows developers to determine if a popover should automatically close on page scroll. By adding the `shouldCloseOnScroll` property, developers can customize popover behavior, improving interaction in dynamic interfaces where user engagement is high. This flexibility addresses user feedback regarding unexpected popover behavior during scrolling.

.changeset/slow-paws-punch.md: ## AI-generated summary of changes

This update introduces a new feature to the `@nextui-org/popover` package, allowing developers to control the behavior of popovers in relation to scrolling events. Specifically, the enhancement adds a `shouldCloseOnScroll` option, which determines whether a popover should automatically close when the user scrolls the page. This functionality improves user experience by providing developers with more control over popover visibility, particularly in dynamic interfaces where user interaction is frequent. The implementation involves adding configuration options or event listeners that manage the popover state based on scroll actions, enhancing the overall interactivity of the component. Additionally, the default behavior of the `shouldBlockScroll` property has been changed from `false` to `true`, indicating that the popover will now block scrolling outside of it by default.

Furthermore, the following changes have been made:

- A new optional property `shouldCloseOnScroll` has been added to the `Props` interface in `use-aria-popover.ts`, which defaults to `false`, determining whether the popover should close on scroll.
- The `useReactAriaPopover` function signature has been updated to include `shouldCloseOnScroll`.
- The `onClose` callback logic has been modified to invoke `state.close` only if both `isNonModal` and `shouldCloseOnScroll` are true.
- The `usePopover` function now includes `shouldCloseOnScroll` in its parameters, allowing for more dynamic closing behavior based on scroll events.
- A new property `shouldCloseOnScroll` has been added to the exported default configuration in `popover.stories.tsx`, with a control type of "boolean".
- A new export, `ShouldNotCloseOnScroll`, has been added to `popover.stories.tsx`, demonstrating the popover's behavior when `shouldCloseOnScroll` is set to false.

## Alterations to the declarations of exported or public entities

- `shouldCloseOnScroll?: boolean` in interface `Props` in `packages/components/popover/src/use-aria-popover.ts`.
- `export function useReactAriaPopover(..., shouldCloseOnScroll = false, ...)` in `packages/components/popover/src/use-aria-popover.ts`.
- `export function usePopover(originalProps: UsePopoverProps & { shouldCloseOnScroll?: boolean })` in `packages/components/popover/src/use-popover.ts`.
- `shouldCloseOnScroll` in `packages/components/popover/stories/popover.stories.tsx` ‚Üí New property added with control type "boolean".
- `export const ShouldNotCloseOnScroll` in `packages/components/popover/stories/popover.stories.tsx` ‚Üí New export added with a render function and args including `shouldCloseOnScroll: false`.
- `shouldBlockScroll: boolean` in `Popover` component documentation ‚Üí `shouldBlockScroll: boolean` in `Popover` component documentation (default changed from `false` to `true`).
- New property `shouldCloseOnScroll: boolean` added in `Popover` component documentation (default is `false`).

packages/components/popover/__tests__/popover.test.tsx: ## AI-generated summary of changes

The diff introduces modifications to the test case for the `Popover` component within the test suite. Specifically, the description of the test case has been updated to clarify that the popover should close on scroll only when the `shouldCloseOnScroll` prop is set to `true`. Additionally, a new test case has been added to verify that the popover remains open during a scroll event when the `shouldCloseOnScroll` prop is set to `false`. This change enhances the specificity of the test by making it clear that the behavior being tested is conditional based on the prop's value. The instantiation of the `Popover` component in the test has been updated to include the `shouldCloseOnScroll` prop, ensuring that the test accurately reflects the intended functionality of the component.

## Alterations to the declarations of exported or public entities

- `it("should close popover on scroll", async () => {` in `packages/components/popover/__tests__/popover.test.tsx` ‚Üí `it("should close popover on scroll when shouldCloseOnScroll is true", async () => {` in `packages/components/popover/__tests__/popover.test.tsx`.
- `it("should close popover on scroll", async () => {` in `packages/components/popover/__tests__/popover.test.tsx` ‚Üí `it("should close popover on scroll when shouldCloseOnScroll is false", async () => {` in `packages/components/popover/__tests__/popover.test.tsx`.
- `<Popover>` in `packages/components/popover/__tests__/popover.test.tsx` ‚Üí `<Popover shouldCloseOnScroll>` in `packages/components/popover/__tests__/popover.test.tsx`.
- `<Popover>` in `packages/components/popover/__tests__/popover.test.tsx` ‚Üí `<Popover shouldCloseOnScroll={false}>` in `packages/components/popover/__tests__/popover.test.tsx`.

## PR Summary

The pull request titled "feat(popover): added control for closing popover on scroll" introduces a new feature to the popover component in the NextUI library. It adds a control named `shouldCloseOnScroll`, which allows developers to specify whether the popover should close when the user scrolls. By default, this control is set to true, meaning the popover will close on scroll unless configured otherwise. This PR addresses a specific bug reported in issue #3594, where users experienced the popover closing unexpectedly upon scrolling in versions 2.4 and higher of NextUI. The pull request includes visual demonstrations of both the current behavior and the new behavior after implementing the feature. It is noted that this change is not a breaking change, ensuring that existing users of NextUI will not encounter issues with their current implementations.

## Objectives from Linked Issues

The linked issue #3594 describes a bug where a popover filled with a substantial amount of content closes immediately when the user begins to scroll. This issue was observed in versions 2.4 and above of NextUI, while version 2.3 did not exhibit this behavior. The user expected the popover to remain open while scrolling, only closing when they clicked outside of it or re-triggered the popover. The objective of the linked issue is to resolve this unintended behavior, allowing users to scroll through the content of the popover without it closing unexpectedly. The implementation of the `shouldCloseOnScroll` control in the pull request aims to fulfill this objective by providing users with the option to maintain the popover's visibility during scrolling.

### Chat

There are 3 ways to chat with [CodeRabbit](https://coderabbit.ai):

- Review comments: Directly reply to a review comment made by CodeRabbit. Example:
  - `I pushed a fix in commit <commit_id>, please review it.`
  - `Generate unit testing code for this file.`
  - `Open a follow-up GitHub issue for this discussion.`
- Files and specific lines of code (under the "Files changed" tab): Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new review comment at the desired location with your query. Examples:
  - `@coderabbitai generate unit testing code for this file.`
  -	`@coderabbitai modularize this function.`
- PR comments: Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new PR comment to ask questions about the PR branch. For the best results, please provide a very specific query, as very limited context is provided in this mode. Examples:
  - `@coderabbitai gather interesting stats about this repository and render them as a table. Additionally, render a pie chart showing the language distribution in the codebase.`
  - `@coderabbitai read src/utils.ts and generate unit testing code.`
  - `@coderabbitai read the files in the src/scheduler package and generate a class diagram using mermaid and a README in the markdown format.`
  - `@coderabbitai help me debug CodeRabbit configuration file.`

Note: Be mindful of the bot's finite context window. It's strongly recommended to break down tasks such as reading entire modules into smaller chunks. For a focused discussion, use review comments to chat about specific files and their changes, instead of using the PR comments.
