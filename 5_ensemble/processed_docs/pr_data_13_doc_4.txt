## Walkthrough
The recent update to the `Cmdk` component improves the user experience by adjusting the conditional rendering logic for the "No results" message. This ensures that the message displays correctly when a user searches with minimal characters, addressing issues with user feedback during short or empty search queries.

## Changes

| File Path                  | Change Summary |
|----------------------------|----------------|
| `apps/docs/components/cmdk.tsx` | Adjusted conditional rendering for "No results" message based on query length. |

## Assessment against linked issues

| Objective                                                                 | Addressed | Explanation |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-------------|
| Ensure "No results" message displays correctly for one-character searches (#2643) | ‚úÖ         |             |
| Fix issue where Cmdk ESC does not work without recent search results cache (#2643) | ‚ùå         | The provided changes do not address the ESC key functionality. |

The adjustments made in the `Cmdk` component focus solely on improving the display of the "No results" message, successfully addressing the issue related to displaying appropriate feedback for short search queries. However, the issue concerning the ESC key functionality when there is no cache of recent search results remains unaddressed in this update.

apps/docs/components/cmdk.tsx: ## Short Summary

In the `Cmdk` component, the conditional rendering logic for displaying "No results" message has been adjusted to wrap the condition around the `<Command.Empty>` component, ensuring proper display based on the query length.

### PR Objectives (User Provided Facts)

This pull request (PR #2721) addresses a bug in the NextUI library, specifically within the command modal (cmdk) component. The issue, documented in #2643, describes two main problems:

1. **Single Character Search Issue**: When a user inputs a single character in the search modal, it fails to return any results. The expected behavior, as suggested, should be to inform the user that no results were found and to try adding more characters to the search term.

2. **Escape Key Functionality**: The escape (ESC) key does not function in the cmdk modal when there are no recent search results cached. This functionality is crucial for enhancing user experience by allowing users to exit the search modal smoothly regardless of the search history state.

The PR aims to fix these issues by modifying the conditional rendering logic in the `Cmdk` component. The changes ensure that a message is displayed when no results are found, particularly when searching with a single character. Additionally, it addresses the escape key functionality to work independently of the search results cache.

The PR is categorized under bug fixes and does not introduce any breaking changes or new external dependencies. It includes a link to a visual representation of the new behavior but does not detail the technical specifics of the implementation in the description.

### AI-Generated Summary of Generated Summaries

The pull request makes adjustments to the `Cmdk` component in the NextUI library. Specifically, it modifies the conditional rendering logic associated with displaying the "No results" message. This change ensures that the message is appropriately shown when searches yield no results, particularly for single-character queries. This update addresses user experience issues by providing clearer feedback during search operations and ensuring functional consistency with the escape key in the search modal.

Ensure consistent handling of "No results" message for single-character searches.

The conditional logic for displaying the "No results" message has been adjusted to handle single-character searches specifically. This change aligns with the PR's objective to improve user feedback when the search results are empty. However, ensure that this logic is robust against edge cases, such as rapid changes in the query state.

Verify the implementation of the escape key functionality.

The escape key functionality, crucial for user experience, should allow closing the modal regardless of the search history state. This functionality isn't directly visible in the provided code snippet. Please ensure that the `onClose` method is correctly triggered by the escape key under all conditions, including when there are no recent search results.

Confirm the necessity of `router` and `query` for navigation and search functionality.

The `router` is used to handle navigation when a search result is selected, and the `query` state is essential for managing the search input and results. Both are appropriately used in the component's logic and are necessary for its functionality.

<summary>Tips</summary>

### Chat

There are 3 ways to chat with [CodeRabbit](https://coderabbit.ai):

- Review comments: Directly reply to a review comment made by CodeRabbit. Example:
	- `I pushed a fix in commit <commit_id>.`
	- `Generate unit testing code for this file.`
	- `Open a follow-up GitHub issue for this discussion.`
- Files and specific lines of code (under the "Files changed" tab): Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new review comment at the desired location with your query. Examples:
	- `@coderabbitai generate unit testing code for this file.`
	-	`@coderabbitai modularize this function.`
- PR comments: Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new PR comment to ask questions about the PR branch. For the best results, please provide a very specific query, as very limited context is provided in this mode. Examples:
	- `@coderabbitai generate interesting stats about this repository and render them as a table.`
	- `@coderabbitai show all the console.log statements in this repository.`
	- `@coderabbitai read src/utils.ts and generate unit testing code.`
	- `@coderabbitai read the files in the src/scheduler package and generate a class diagram using mermaid and a README in the markdown format.`

Note: Be mindful of the bot's finite context window. It's strongly recommended to break down tasks such as reading entire modules into smaller chunks. For a focused discussion, use review comments to chat about specific files and their changes, instead of using the PR comments.

### CodeRabbit Commands (invoked as PR comments)

- `@coderabbitai pause` to pause the reviews on a PR.
- `@coderabbitai resume` to resume the paused reviews.
- `@coderabbitai review` to trigger a review. This is useful when automatic reviews are disabled for the repository.
- `@coderabbitai resolve` resolve all the CodeRabbit review comments.
- `@coderabbitai help` to get help.


Additionally, you can add `@coderabbitai ignore` anywhere in the PR description to prevent this PR from being reviewed.
