## PR Summary

The pull request titled "docs: dead link fix for ValidationResults" was submitted by the user anOatFlake and is identified as PR number 3797. This PR addresses an issue related to dead links in the documentation for the NextUI library, specifically concerning the links to ValidationResults. The changes made include the removal of duplicated brackets in Markdown links, which previously caused the links to not function correctly. As a result of this fix, the links to ValidationResults now open in a new tab, ensuring proper navigation. The PR does not introduce any breaking changes to the existing functionality. This pull request is linked to issue #3795, which reported the dead link problem.

## Objectives from Linked Issues

The linked issue, titled "[BUG] [DOCS] - Dead Link in Datepicker Docs" (issue #3795), outlines a specific bug in the documentation for the NextUI library, version 2.4.8. The issue describes that the documentation pages for various components, including the datepicker, time input, date range picker, and date input, contain a link that does not navigate correctly to the ValidationResult section on GitHub. Users are directed to a specific URL, which, when clicked, fails to redirect to the intended GitHub file. The expected behavior is for the link to successfully redirect users to the relevant documentation. The issue provides steps to reproduce the problem, highlighting the need for a fix to ensure proper navigation and user experience.

### Chat

There are 3 ways to chat with [CodeRabbit](https://coderabbit.ai):

- Review comments: Directly reply to a review comment made by CodeRabbit. Example:
-- `I pushed a fix in commit <commit_id>, please review it.`
-- `Generate unit testing code for this file.`
	- `Open a follow-up GitHub issue for this discussion.`
- Files and specific lines of code (under the "Files changed" tab): Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new review comment at the desired location with your query. Examples:
-- `@coderabbitai generate unit testing code for this file.`
--	`@coderabbitai modularize this function.`
- PR comments: Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new PR comment to ask questions about the PR branch. For the best results, please provide a very specific query, as very limited context is provided in this mode. Examples:
-- `@coderabbitai gather interesting stats about this repository and render them as a table. Additionally, render a pie chart showing the language distribution in the codebase.`
-- `@coderabbitai read src/utils.ts and generate unit testing code.`
-- `@coderabbitai read the files in the src/scheduler package and generate a class diagram using mermaid and a README in the markdown format.`
-- `@coderabbitai help me debug CodeRabbit configuration file.`

Note: Be mindful of the bot's finite context window. It's strongly recommended to break down tasks such as reading entire modules into smaller chunks. For a focused discussion, use review comments to chat about specific files and their changes, instead of using the PR comments.

### CodeRabbit Commands (Invoked using PR comments)

- `@coderabbitai pause` to pause the reviews on a PR.
- `@coderabbitai resume` to resume the paused reviews.
- `@coderabbitai review` to trigger an incremental review. This is useful when automatic reviews are disabled for the repository.
- `@coderabbitai full review` to do a full review from scratch and review all the files again.
- `@coderabbitai summary` to regenerate the summary of the PR.
- `@coderabbitai resolve` resolve all the CodeRabbit review comments.
- `@coderabbitai configuration` to show the current CodeRabbit configuration for the repository.
- `@coderabbitai help` to get help.

### Other keywords and placeholders

- Add `@coderabbitai ignore` anywhere in the PR description to prevent this PR from being reviewed.
- Add `@coderabbitai summary` to generate the high-level summary at a specific location in the PR description.
- Add `@coderabbitai` anywhere in the PR title to generate the title automatically.
