## Walkthrough

This update introduces a patch for the `@nextui-org/modal` and `@nextui-org/theme` packages, specifically addressing the issue of modal positioning when the on-screen keyboard is activated. The changes ensure that modals dynamically adjust their position to remain visible and accessible during keyboard interactions, particularly on mobile devices. Additionally, viewport size management is incorporated to enhance the modal's responsiveness.

.changeset/seven-apricots-happen.md: ## AI-generated summary of changes

This new file introduces a patch for the `@nextui-org/modal` and `@nextui-org/theme` packages, focusing on the adjustment of modal positioning in response to keyboard visibility. The functionality aims to enhance user experience by ensuring that modals remain accessible and properly aligned when the on-screen keyboard is activated. This adjustment is particularly relevant for mobile and tablet interfaces where keyboard interactions can obscure important UI elements. The logic implemented ensures that the modal dynamically recalibrates its position based on the keyboard's state, thereby maintaining usability and visual coherence.

Additionally, the changes in the `modal-content.tsx` file enhance the functionality of the `ModalContent` component by incorporating viewport size management. The import statement has been updated to include `useViewportSize` from `@react-aria/utils`, allowing the component to dynamically adapt to the viewport dimensions. A new constant `viewport` is defined using the `useViewportSize` hook, which retrieves the current height of the viewport. This value is utilized to create a `viewportStyle` object that sets a CSS variable `--visual-viewport-height` to the viewport height in pixels, ensuring that the modal is not obscured by the keyboard when displayed.

Furthermore, the diff introduces a new utility class `"h-[--visual-viewport-height]"` to the `modal` component's styling configuration. This addition enhances the modal's responsiveness by allowing it to adapt its height based on the visual viewport height, which is particularly beneficial for mobile devices where the viewport may change due to on-screen keyboards or other UI elements.

## PR Summary

The pull request titled "fix(modal): modal position when keyboard appears" was created by the user wingkwong and is identified as PR number 3691. It addresses an issue reported in issue #2837, where the modal dialog in the NextUI framework does not adjust its position when the keyboard appears on iOS devices. This behavior was observed after updating from version 2.2.X to 2.3.X of NextUI. The current behavior results in the modal remaining fixed at the bottom of the screen, which obscures input fields and hinders user interaction, particularly in forms that require user input. The proposed changes aim to modify the modal's behavior so that it shifts its position appropriately when the keyboard is displayed, ensuring that input fields remain visible to users. The pull request does not indicate whether the changes are breaking and invites further review and feedback.

## Objectives from Linked Issues

The linked issue, titled "[BUG] - Modal does not adjust position when keyboard appears on iOS," outlines a specific problem affecting users of the NextUI framework. The issue was reported for version 2.3.5 and highlights that after an update from version 2.2.X, the modal dialog fails to reposition itself when the iOS keyboard is activated. This results in the modal obscuring input fields, which significantly impacts usability, especially in scenarios requiring user input, such as forms and dialogs. The expected behavior is for the modal to move upward when the keyboard appears, allowing users to see what they are typing. The issue provides a clear reproduction path, detailing the steps to recreate the problem on an iOS device using Safari. The objective is to ensure that the modal's position adjusts correctly in response to the keyboard's appearance, thereby improving the user experience on iOS devices.

### Chat

There are 3 ways to chat with [CodeRabbit](https://coderabbit.ai):

- Review comments: Directly reply to a review comment made by CodeRabbit. Example:
	- `I pushed a fix in commit <commit_id>.`
	- `Generate unit testing code for this file.`
	- `Open a follow-up GitHub issue for this discussion.`
- Files and specific lines of code (under the "Files changed" tab): Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new review comment at the desired location with your query. Examples:
	- `@coderabbitai generate unit testing code for this file.`
	-	`@coderabbitai modularize this function.`
- PR comments: Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new PR comment to ask questions about the PR branch. For the best results, please provide a very specific query, as very limited context is provided in this mode. Examples:
	- `@coderabbitai generate interesting stats about this repository and render them as a table.`
	- `@coderabbitai show all the console.log statements in this repository.`
	- `@coderabbitai read src/utils.ts and generate unit testing code.`
	- `@coderabbitai read the files in the src/scheduler package and generate a class diagram using mermaid and a README in the markdown format.`
	- `@coderabbitai help me debug CodeRabbit configuration file.`

Note: Be mindful of the bot's finite context window. It's strongly recommended to break down tasks such as reading entire modules into smaller chunks. For a focused discussion, use review comments to chat about specific files and their changes, instead of using the PR comments.
