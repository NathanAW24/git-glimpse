## PR Summary

**Title:** fix(listbox): card shadow clipping when inside listbox item  
**User:** abhinandan-verma  
**Number:** 3486  
**URL:** [https://github.com/nextui-org/nextui/pull/3486](https://github.com/nextui-org/nextui/pull/3486)

**Description:**  
This pull request addresses the issue of card shadow clipping when a card is placed inside a `listbox-item` or `menubox-item`. The clipping was caused by the `overflow: hidden` property in the `truncate` class. The PR fixes this issue to ensure that the card's shadow is fully visible.

**Current Behavior:**  
The shadow of a card nested inside a `listbox-item` is cut off.

**New Behavior:**  
The shadow of the card is fully visible and not clipped.

**Breaking Change:** No

## Objectives from Linked Issues

**Linked Issue:** #3480

**Title:** [BUG] - Card's shadow cut off when nested inside ListBoxItem

**Description:**  
The shadow of a `Card` component nested inside a `ListBoxItem` is cut off due to the `overflow: hidden` property in the `truncate` class.

**NextUI Version:** 2.4.2

**Steps to Reproduce the Bug or Issue:**
1. Create a new project.
2. Add a `listbox` and a `card`.
3. Use the following code in `App.tsx`:
    ```tsx
    import { Card, CardBody, CardHeader } from "@nextui-org/card";
    import { Listbox, ListboxItem } from "@nextui-org/listbox";

    function App() {
      return (
        <Listbox aria-label="test">
          <ListboxItem key="test" textValue="test">
            <Card shadow="lg">
              <CardHeader>header</CardHeader>
              <CardBody>body</CardBody>
            </Card>
          </ListboxItem>
        </Listbox>
      );
    }

    export default App;
    ```

**Expected Behavior:**  
The shadow of the card should be fully visible and not cut off when nested inside a `ListBoxItem`.

**Screenshots or Videos:**
- Shadow is cut off:

<summary>Tips</summary>

### Chat

There are 3 ways to chat with [CodeRabbit](https://coderabbit.ai):

- Review comments: Directly reply to a review comment made by CodeRabbit. Example:
	- `I pushed a fix in commit <commit_id>.`
	- `Generate unit testing code for this file.`
	- `Open a follow-up GitHub issue for this discussion.`
- Files and specific lines of code (under the "Files changed" tab): Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new review comment at the desired location with your query. Examples:
	- `@coderabbitai generate unit testing code for this file.`
	-	`@coderabbitai modularize this function.`
- PR comments: Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new PR comment to ask questions about the PR branch. For the best results, please provide a very specific query, as very limited context is provided in this mode. Examples:
	- `@coderabbitai generate interesting stats about this repository and render them as a table.`
	- `@coderabbitai show all the console.log statements in this repository.`
	- `@coderabbitai read src/utils.ts and generate unit testing code.`
	- `@coderabbitai read the files in the src/scheduler package and generate a class diagram using mermaid and a README in the markdown format.`
	- `@coderabbitai help me debug CodeRabbit configuration file.`

Note: Be mindful of the bot's finite context window. It's strongly recommended to break down tasks such as reading entire modules into smaller chunks. For a focused discussion, use review comments to chat about specific files and their changes, instead of using the PR comments.

### CodeRabbit Commands (invoked as PR comments)

- `@coderabbitai pause` to pause the reviews on a PR.
- `@coderabbitai resume` to resume the paused reviews.
- `@coderabbitai review` to trigger an incremental review. This is useful when automatic reviews are disabled for the repository.
- `@coderabbitai full review` to do a full review from scratch and review all the files again.
- `@coderabbitai summary` to regenerate the summary of the PR.
- `@coderabbitai resolve` resolve all the CodeRabbit review comments.
- `@coderabbitai configuration` to show the current CodeRabbit configuration for the repository.
- `@coderabbitai help` to get help.


Additionally, you can add `@coderabbitai ignore` anywhere in the PR description to prevent this PR from being reviewed.

### CodeRabbit Configuration File (`.coderabbit.yaml`)

- You can programmatically configure CodeRabbit by adding a `.coderabbit.yaml` file to the root of your repository.
- Please see the [configuration documentation](https://docs.coderabbit.ai/guides/configure-coderabbit) for more information.
- If your editor has YAML language server enabled, you can add the path at the top of this file to enable auto-completion and validation: `# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://coderabbit.ai/integrations/schema.v2.json`
